# Sandbox Repository

This folder is a **isolated testing and experimentation environment**

**Every time it is compiled (using the script `./build.sh`), the output is **redirected** to the `Sandbox/` directory.**
  
* Here, the `.so` files (shared libraries) will be available
  for experimentation, prototyping, and testing purposes.

* The `Resources/` folder contains a collection of publicly accessible files in various formats (.doc, .pdf, .txt), used to test the functionalities of the different loaders. These materials are assumed to be free of patent restrictions or in the public domain.
