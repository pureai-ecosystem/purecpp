## 💪🏽 Quick Start Guide

Ready to jump in? Follow this quick setup guide to get started smoothly:

1. **Fork** the repo and clone your fork.
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd purecpp
   ```

3. Make sure you have the following packages installed:
- GCC/G++ 13.1
- CMake 3.22+
- Conan 2
- Rust
- Python 3.8+

4. Install the required dependencies:`:
Depending on your system, you may need:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y gcc-13 g++-13 cmake conan rustc cargo
   ```
5.  Install development conan dependencies::

   ```bash
        !pip install conan==2.*
   ```

6. Run the tests to ensure everything is working::
   ```bash
        ./tests/run_tests
   ```


 All set! Now it's time to build something powerful. If you need more details, check out the [Development Guidelines](#-Development-Guidelines).
