Subscribe to our free eBooks blog \\r\\nand email newsletter.\\r\\n1984\\r\\nBy George Orwell\\n\\x18 1984\\r\\nPart One\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com \\x18\\r\\nChapter 1\\r\\nI\\r\\nt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were strik\\x02ing thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his \\r\\nbreast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly \\r\\nthrough the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not \\r\\nquickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from enter\\x02ing along with him.\\r\\nThe hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At \\r\\none end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, \\r\\nhad been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enor\\x02mous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of \\r\\nabout forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and rugged\\x02ly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was \\r\\nno use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was sel\\x02dom working, and at present the electric current was cut \\r\\noff during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive \\r\\nin preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, \\r\\nand Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer \\r\\nabove his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on \\r\\nthe way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster \\r\\nwith the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of \\r\\nthose pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow \\r\\nyou about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING \\r\\nYOU, the caption beneath it ran.\\r\\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of fig-\\n1984\\r\\nures which had something to do with the production of \\r\\npig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like \\r\\na dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the \\r\\nright-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice \\r\\nsank somewhat, though the words were still distinguish\\x02able. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be \\r\\ndimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off complete\\x02ly. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, \\r\\nthe meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue \\r\\noveralls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was \\r\\nvery fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by \\r\\ncoarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the win\\x02ter that had just ended.\\r\\nOutside, even through the shut window-pane, the world \\r\\nlooked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were \\r\\nwhirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the \\r\\nsun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed \\r\\nto be no colour in anything, except the posters that were \\r\\nplastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio’d face gazed \\r\\ndown from every commanding corner. There was one on \\r\\nthe house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS \\r\\nWATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes \\r\\nlooked deep into Winston’s own. Down at street level an\\x02other poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, \\r\\nalternately covering and uncovering the single word IN\\x02GSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down \\r\\nbetween the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, \\r\\nand darted away again with a curving flight. It was the po\\x02lice patrol, snooping into people’s windows. The patrols did \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com \\x18\\r\\nnot matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.\\r\\nBehind Winston’s back the voice from the telescreen was \\r\\nstill babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment \\r\\nof the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and \\r\\ntransmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, \\r\\nabove the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by \\r\\nit, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vi\\x02sion which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen \\r\\nas well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing \\r\\nwhether you were being watched at any given moment. How \\r\\noften, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on \\r\\nany individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable \\r\\nthat they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate \\r\\nthey could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You \\r\\nhad to live—did live, from habit that became instinct—in \\r\\nthe assumption that every sound you made was overheard, \\r\\nand, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.\\r\\nWinston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was \\r\\nsafer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. \\r\\nA kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, \\r\\ntowered vast and white above the grimy landscape. This, \\r\\nhe thought with a sort of vague distaste—this was London, \\r\\nchief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous \\r\\nof the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some \\r\\nchildhood memory that should tell him whether London \\r\\nhad always been quite like this. Were there always these vis\\x02tas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored \\r\\nup with baulks of timber, their windows patched with card\\x02board and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy \\n\\x18 1984\\r\\ngarden walls sagging in all directions? And the bombed \\r\\nsites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the wil\\x02low-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places \\r\\nwhere the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had \\r\\nsprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chick\\x02en-houses? But it was no use, he could not remember: \\r\\nnothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright\\x02lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly \\r\\nunintelligible.\\r\\nThe Ministry of Truth—Minitrue, in Newspeak [New\\x02speak was the official language of Oceania. For an account \\r\\nof its structure and etymology see Appendix.]—was star\\x02tlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an \\r\\nenormous pyramidal structure of glittering white con\\x02crete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the \\r\\nair. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, \\r\\npicked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three \\r\\nslogans of the Party:\\r\\nWAR IS PEACE \\r\\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY \\r\\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\\r\\nThe Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three \\r\\nthousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding \\r\\nramifications below. Scattered about London there were \\r\\njust three other buildings of similar appearance and size. \\r\\nSo completely did they dwarf the surrounding architec\\x02ture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com \\x18\\r\\nall four of them simultaneously. They were the homes of \\r\\nthe four Ministries between which the entire apparatus \\r\\nof government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which \\r\\nconcerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and \\r\\nthe fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself \\r\\nwith war. The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and \\r\\norder. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible \\r\\nfor economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, \\r\\nMinipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.\\r\\nThe Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. \\r\\nThere were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been \\r\\ninside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it. \\r\\nIt was a place impossible to enter except on official business, \\r\\nand then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed\\x02wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun \\r\\nnests. Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were \\r\\nroamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armed \\r\\nwith jointed truncheons.\\r\\nWinston turned round abruptly. He had set his features \\r\\ninto the expression of quiet optimism which it was advis\\x02able to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the \\r\\nroom into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at this \\r\\ntime of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and \\r\\nhe was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except \\r\\na hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved \\r\\nfor tomorrow’s breakfast. He took down from the shelf a \\r\\nbottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked \\r\\nVICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese \\r\\nrice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved \\n1984\\r\\nhimself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medi\\x02cine.\\r\\nInstantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out \\r\\nof his eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in \\r\\nswallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back \\r\\nof the head with a rubber club. The next moment, however, \\r\\nthe burning in his belly died down and the world began to \\r\\nlook more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled \\r\\npacket marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously \\r\\nheld it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the \\r\\nfloor. With the next he was more successful. He went back \\r\\nto the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood \\r\\nto the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took \\r\\nout a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized \\r\\nblank book with a red back and a marbled cover.\\r\\nFor some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in \\r\\nan unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, \\r\\nin the end wall, where it could command the whole room, \\r\\nit was in the longer wall, opposite the window. To one side \\r\\nof it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now \\r\\nsitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably \\r\\nbeen intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, \\r\\nand keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside \\r\\nthe range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could \\r\\nbe heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present \\r\\nposition he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual ge\\x02ography of the room that had suggested to him the thing \\r\\nthat he was now about to do.\\r\\nBut it had also been suggested by the book that he had \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\r\\njust taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful \\r\\nbook. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was \\r\\nof a kind that had not been manufactured for at least for\\x02ty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was \\r\\nmuch older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of \\r\\na frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town \\r\\n(just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been \\r\\nstricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess \\r\\nit. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary \\r\\nshops (’dealing on the free market’, it was called), but the \\r\\nrule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, \\r\\nsuch as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible \\r\\nto get hold of in any other way. He had given a quick glance \\r\\nup and down the street and then had slipped inside and \\r\\nbought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not \\r\\nconscious of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had \\r\\ncarried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothing \\r\\nwritten in it, it was a compromising possession.\\r\\nThe thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. \\r\\nThis was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no \\r\\nlonger any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain \\r\\nthat it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty\\x02five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into \\r\\nthe penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen \\r\\nwas an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, \\r\\nand he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, \\r\\nsimply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper \\r\\ndeserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being \\r\\nscratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to \\n10 1984\\r\\nwriting by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usu\\x02al to dictate everything into the speak-write which was of \\r\\ncourse impossible for his present purpose. He dipped the \\r\\npen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. A trem\\x02or had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the \\r\\ndecisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:\\r\\nApril 4th, 1984.\\r\\nHe sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had de\\x02scended upon him. To begin with, he did not know with any \\r\\ncertainty that this was 1984. It must be round about that \\r\\ndate, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, \\r\\nand he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but \\r\\nit was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within \\r\\na year or two.\\r\\nFor whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he \\r\\nwriting this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind \\r\\nhovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, \\r\\nand then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak \\r\\nword DOUBLETHINK. For the first time the magnitude of \\r\\nwhat he had undertaken came home to him. How could you \\r\\ncommunicate with the future? It was of its nature impossi\\x02ble. Either the future would resemble the present, in which \\r\\ncase it would not listen to him: or it would be different from \\r\\nit, and his predicament would be meaningless.\\r\\nFor some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The \\r\\ntelescreen had changed over to strident military music. It \\r\\nwas curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the pow-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 11\\r\\ner of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it \\r\\nwas that he had originally intended to say. For weeks past \\r\\nhe had been making ready for this moment, and it had nev\\x02er crossed his mind that anything would be needed except \\r\\ncourage. The actual writing would be easy. All he had to \\r\\ndo was to transfer to paper the interminable restless mono\\x02logue that had been running inside his head, literally for \\r\\nyears. At this moment, however, even the monologue had \\r\\ndried up. Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching \\r\\nunbearably. He dared not scratch it, because if he did so it \\r\\nalways became inflamed. The seconds were ticking by. He \\r\\nwas conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page \\r\\nin front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the \\r\\nblaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the \\r\\ngin.\\r\\nSuddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imper\\x02fectly aware of what he was setting down. His small but \\r\\nchildish handwriting straggled up and down the page, shed\\x02ding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops:\\r\\nApril 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One \\r\\nvery good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed \\r\\nsomewhere in the Mediterranean. Audience much amused \\r\\nby shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with \\r\\na helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along \\r\\nin the water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the \\r\\nhelicopters gunsights, then he was full of holes and the sea \\r\\nround him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though \\r\\nthe holes had let in the water, audience shouting with laughter \\n12 1984\\r\\nwhen he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a \\r\\nhelicopter hovering over it. there was a middle-aged woman \\r\\nmight have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little \\r\\nboy about three years old in her arms. little boy screaming \\r\\nwith fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he \\r\\nwas trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting \\r\\nher arms round him and comforting him although she was \\r\\nblue with fright herself, all the time covering him up as much \\r\\nas possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets \\r\\noff him. then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among \\r\\nthem terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood. then \\r\\nthere was a wonderful shot of a child’s arm going up up up \\r\\nright up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose \\r\\nmust have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from \\r\\nthe party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the \\r\\nhouse suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they \\r\\ndidnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it \\r\\naint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned \\r\\nher turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her \\r\\nnobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they \\r\\nnever——\\r\\nWinston stopped writing, partly because he was suffer\\x02ing from cramp. He did not know what had made him pour \\r\\nout this stream of rubbish. But the curious thing was that \\r\\nwhile he was doing so a totally different memory had clar\\x02ified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt \\r\\nequal to writing it down. It was, he now realized, because \\r\\nof this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 13\\r\\nhome and begin the diary today.\\r\\nIt had happened that morning at the Ministry, if any\\x02thing so nebulous could be said to happen.\\r\\nIt was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records De\\x02partment, where Winston worked, they were dragging the \\r\\nchairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the cen\\x02tre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for \\r\\nthe Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place \\r\\nin one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew \\r\\nby sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into \\r\\nthe room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed in \\r\\nthe corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that \\r\\nshe worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably—since \\r\\nhe had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a \\r\\nspanner—she had some mechanical job on one of the nov\\x02el-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of about \\r\\ntwenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, \\r\\nathletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the \\r\\nJunior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round \\r\\nthe waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the \\r\\nshapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the \\r\\nvery first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was \\r\\nbecause of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths \\r\\nand community hikes and general clean-mindedness which \\r\\nshe managed to carry about with her. He disliked nearly all \\r\\nwomen, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was al\\x02ways the women, and above all the young ones, who were \\r\\nthe most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers \\r\\nof slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unortho-\\n14 1984\\r\\ndoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression of \\r\\nbeing more dangerous than most. Once when they passed \\r\\nin the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which \\r\\nseemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled \\r\\nhim with black terror. The idea had even crossed his mind \\r\\nthat she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That, it \\r\\nwas true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a pe\\x02culiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as \\r\\nhostility, whenever she was anywhere near him.\\r\\nThe other person was a man named O’Brien, a member \\r\\nof the Inner Party and holder of some post so important \\r\\nand remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature. \\r\\nA momentary hush passed over the group of people round \\r\\nthe chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party \\r\\nmember approaching. O’Brien was a large, burly man with \\r\\na thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite of \\r\\nhis formidable appearance he had a certain charm of man\\x02ner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose \\r\\nwhich was curiously disarming—in some indefinable way, \\r\\ncuriously civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had \\r\\nstill thought in such terms, might have recalled an eigh\\x02teenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox. Winston \\r\\nhad seen O’Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many \\r\\nyears. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because \\r\\nhe was intrigued by the contrast between O’Brien’s urbane \\r\\nmanner and his prize-fighter’s physique. Much more it was \\r\\nbecause of a secretly held belief—or perhaps not even a be\\x02lief, merely a hope—that O’Brien’s political orthodoxy was \\r\\nnot perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 15\\r\\nAnd again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was \\r\\nwritten in his face, but simply intelligence. But at any rate \\r\\nhe had the appearance of being a person that you could \\r\\ntalk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get \\r\\nhim alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to \\r\\nverify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At \\r\\nthis moment O’Brien glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that it \\r\\nwas nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in \\r\\nthe Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was \\r\\nover. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple \\r\\nof places away. A small, sandy-haired woman who worked \\r\\nin the next cubicle to Winston was between them. The girl \\r\\nwith dark hair was sitting immediately behind.\\r\\nThe next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some \\r\\nmonstrous machine running without oil, burst from the \\r\\nbig telescreen at the end of the room. It was a noise that set \\r\\none’s teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one’s \\r\\nneck. The Hate had started.\\r\\nAs usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of \\r\\nthe People, had flashed on to the screen. There were hisses \\r\\nhere and there among the audience. The little sandy-haired \\r\\nwoman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust. Gold\\x02stein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago \\r\\n(how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of \\r\\nthe leading figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big \\r\\nBrother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolu\\x02tionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had \\r\\nmysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes of \\r\\nthe Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was \\n16 1984\\r\\nnone in which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He \\r\\nwas the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party’s pu\\x02rity. All subsequent crimes against the Party, all treacheries, \\r\\nacts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out \\r\\nof his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still alive and \\r\\nhatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the \\r\\nsea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps \\r\\neven—so it was occasionally rumoured—in some hiding\\x02place in Oceania itself.\\r\\nWinston’s diaphragm was constricted. He could never \\r\\nsee the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emo\\x02tions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of \\r\\nwhite hair and a small goatee beard—a clever face, and yet \\r\\nsomehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile sil\\x02liness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair \\r\\nof spectacles was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, \\r\\nand the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality. Goldstein was \\r\\ndelivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines \\r\\nof the Party—an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a \\r\\nchild should have been able to see through it, and yet just \\r\\nplausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that \\r\\nother people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken \\r\\nin by it. He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing \\r\\nthe dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the imme\\x02diate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating \\r\\nfreedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of as\\x02sembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that \\r\\nthe revolution had been betrayed—and all this in rapid \\r\\npolysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the ha-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 17\\r\\nbitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained \\r\\nNewspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any \\r\\nParty member would normally use in real life. And all the \\r\\nwhile, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which \\r\\nGoldstein’s specious claptrap covered, behind his head on \\r\\nthe telescreen there marched the endless columns of the \\r\\nEurasian army—row after row of solid-looking men with \\r\\nexpressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface \\r\\nof the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exact\\x02ly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers’ boots \\r\\nformed the background to Goldstein’s bleating voice.\\r\\nBefore the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncon\\x02trollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half \\r\\nthe people in the room. The self-satisfied sheep-like face on \\r\\nthe screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army \\r\\nbehind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or \\r\\neven the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger au\\x02tomatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than \\r\\neither Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war \\r\\nwith one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the \\r\\nother. But what was strange was that although Goldstein \\r\\nwas hated and despised by everybody, although every day \\r\\nand a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, \\r\\nin newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, \\r\\nridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rub\\x02bish that they were—in spite of all this, his influence never \\r\\nseemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes waiting \\r\\nto be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and \\r\\nsaboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked \\n18 1984\\r\\nby the Thought Police. He was the commander of a vast \\r\\nshadowy army, an underground network of conspirators \\r\\ndedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, \\r\\nits name was supposed to be. There were also whispered \\r\\nstories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, \\r\\nof which Goldstein was the author and which circulated \\r\\nclandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title. \\r\\nPeople referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one \\r\\nknew of such things only through vague rumours. Neither \\r\\nthe Brotherhood nor THE BOOK was a subject that any or\\x02dinary Party member would mention if there was a way of \\r\\navoiding it.\\r\\nIn its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People \\r\\nwere leaping up and down in their places and shouting \\r\\nat the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the mad\\x02dening bleating voice that came from the screen. The \\r\\nlittle sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and \\r\\nher mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed \\r\\nfish. Even O’Brien’s heavy face was flushed. He was sitting \\r\\nvery straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and \\r\\nquivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a \\r\\nwave. The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun cry\\x02ing out ‘Swine! Swine! Swine!’ and suddenly she picked up \\r\\na heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It \\r\\nstruck Goldstein’s nose and bounced off; the voice contin\\x02ued inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he \\r\\nwas shouting with the others and kicking his heel violent\\x02ly against the rung of his chair. The horrible thing about \\r\\nthe Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 19\\r\\na part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid \\r\\njoining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always \\r\\nunnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, \\r\\na desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge\\x02hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people \\r\\nlike an electric current, turning one even against one’s will \\r\\ninto a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that \\r\\none felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could \\r\\nbe switched from one object to another like the flame of a \\r\\nblowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston’s hatred was not \\r\\nturned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against \\r\\nBig Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such \\r\\nmoments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic \\r\\non the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world \\r\\nof lies. And yet the very next instant he was at one with the \\r\\npeople about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed \\r\\nto him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of \\r\\nBig Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed \\r\\nto tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like \\r\\na rock against the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite \\r\\nof his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung \\r\\nabout his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchant\\x02er, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the \\r\\nstructure of civilization.\\r\\nIt was even possible, at moments, to switch one’s ha\\x02tred this way or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the \\r\\nsort of violent effort with which one wrenches one’s head \\r\\naway from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded \\r\\nin transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to \\n20 1984\\r\\nthe dark-haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucina\\x02tions flashed through his mind. He would flog her to death \\r\\nwith a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stake \\r\\nand shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would \\r\\nravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Bet\\x02ter than before, moreover, he realized WHY it was that he \\r\\nhated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty \\r\\nand sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and \\r\\nwould never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, \\r\\nwhich seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there \\r\\nwas only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chas\\x02tity.\\r\\nThe Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had \\r\\nbecome an actual sheep’s bleat, and for an instant the face \\r\\nchanged into that of a sheep. Then the sheep-face melted into \\r\\nthe figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing, \\r\\nhuge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seem\\x02ing to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some \\r\\nof the people in the front row actually flinched backwards \\r\\nin their seats. But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh \\r\\nof relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the \\r\\nface of Big Brother, black-haired, black-moustachio’d, full \\r\\nof power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost \\r\\nfilled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was \\r\\nsaying. It was merely a few words of encouragement, the \\r\\nsort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distin\\x02guishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact \\r\\nof being spoken. Then the face of Big Brother faded away \\r\\nagain, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 21\\r\\nin bold capitals:\\r\\nWAR IS PEACE \\r\\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY \\r\\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\\r\\nBut the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for sever\\x02al seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had \\r\\nmade on everyone’s eyeballs was too vivid to wear off im\\x02mediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flung herself \\r\\nforward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a \\r\\ntremulous murmur that sounded like ‘My Saviour!’ she ex\\x02tended her arms towards the screen. Then she buried her \\r\\nface in her hands. It was apparent that she was uttering a \\r\\nprayer.\\r\\nAt this moment the entire group of people broke into a \\r\\ndeep, slow, rhythmical chant of ‘B-B!...B-B!’—over and over \\r\\nagain, very slowly, with a long pause between the first ‘B’ \\r\\nand the second—a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow \\r\\ncuriously savage, in the background of which one seemed \\r\\nto hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom\\x02toms. For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it \\r\\nup. It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of \\r\\noverwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the \\r\\nwisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was \\r\\nan act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of conscious\\x02ness by means of rhythmic noise. Winston’s entrails seemed \\r\\nto grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help \\r\\nsharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chant-\\n22 1984\\r\\ning of ‘B-B!...B-B!’ always filled him with horror. Of course \\r\\nhe chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. \\r\\nTo dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what \\r\\neveryone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. But \\r\\nthere was a space of a couple of seconds during which the \\r\\nexpression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. \\r\\nAnd it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing \\r\\nhappened—if, indeed, it did happen.\\r\\nMomentarily he caught O’Brien’s eye. O’Brien had stood \\r\\nup. He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of \\r\\nresettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. \\r\\nBut there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, \\r\\nand for as long as it took to happen Winston knew—yes, he \\r\\nKNEW!—that O’Brien was thinking the same thing as him\\x02self. An unmistakable message had passed. It was as though \\r\\ntheir two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing \\r\\nfrom one into the other through their eyes. ‘I am with you,’ \\r\\nO’Brien seemed to be saying to him. ‘I know precisely what \\r\\nyou are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your ha\\x02tred, your disgust. But don’t worry, I am on your side!’ And \\r\\nthen the flash of intelligence was gone, and O’Brien’s face \\r\\nwas as inscrutable as everybody else’s.\\r\\nThat was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had \\r\\nhappened. Such incidents never had any sequel. All that they \\r\\ndid was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that oth\\x02ers besides himself were the enemies of the Party. Perhaps \\r\\nthe rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true \\r\\nafter all—perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was \\r\\nimpossible, in spite of the endless arrests and confessions \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 23\\r\\nand executions, to be sure that the Brotherhood was not \\r\\nsimply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days not. \\r\\nThere was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might \\r\\nmean anything or nothing: snatches of overheard conver\\x02sation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls—once, even, when \\r\\ntwo strangers met, a small movement of the hand which \\r\\nhad looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It \\r\\nwas all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. \\r\\nHe had gone back to his cubicle without looking at O’Brien \\r\\nagain. The idea of following up their momentary contact \\r\\nhardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably \\r\\ndangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. \\r\\nFor a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivo\\x02cal glance, and that was the end of the story. But even that \\r\\nwas a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which \\r\\none had to live.\\r\\nWinston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out \\r\\na belch. The gin was rising from his stomach.\\r\\nHis eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that \\r\\nwhile he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as \\r\\nthough by automatic action. And it was no longer the same \\r\\ncramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slid \\r\\nvoluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat \\r\\ncapitals—DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH \\r\\nBIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN \\r\\nWITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER\\r\\nover and over again, filling half a page.\\r\\nHe could not help feeling a twinge of panic. It was ab\\x02surd, since the writing of those particular words was not \\n24 1984\\r\\nmore dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary, \\r\\nbut for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled \\r\\npages and abandon the enterprise altogether.\\r\\nHe did not do so, however, because he knew that it was \\r\\nuseless. Whether he wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, \\r\\nor whether he refrained from writing it, made no differ\\x02ence. Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did \\r\\nnot go on with it, made no difference. The Thought Police \\r\\nwould get him just the same. He had committed—would \\r\\nstill have committed, even if he had never set pen to pa\\x02per—the essential crime that contained all others in itself. \\r\\nThoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing \\r\\nthat could be concealed for ever. You might dodge success\\x02fully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they \\r\\nwere bound to get you.\\r\\nIt was always at night—the arrests invariably happened \\r\\nat night. The sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shak\\x02ing your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring of \\r\\nhard faces round the bed. In the vast majority of cases there \\r\\nwas no trial, no report of the arrest. People simply disap\\x02peared, always during the night. Your name was removed \\r\\nfrom the registers, every record of everything you had ever \\r\\ndone was wiped out, your one-time existence was denied \\r\\nand then forgotten. You were abolished, annihilated: VA\\x02PORIZED was the usual word.\\r\\nFor a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He be\\x02gan writing in a hurried untidy scrawl:\\r\\ntheyll shoot me i don’t care theyll shoot me in the back of the \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 25\\r\\nneck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot you \\r\\nin the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother——\\r\\nHe sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and \\r\\nlaid down the pen. The next moment he started violently. \\r\\nThere was a knocking at the door.\\r\\nAlready! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that \\r\\nwhoever it was might go away after a single attempt. But no, \\r\\nthe knocking was repeated. The worst thing of all would be \\r\\nto delay. His heart was thumping like a drum, but his face, \\r\\nfrom long habit, was probably expressionless. He got up and \\r\\nmoved heavily towards the door.\\n26 1984\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\nAs he put his hand to the door-knob Winston saw that \\r\\nhe had left the diary open on the table. DOWN WITH \\r\\nBIG BROTHER was written all over it, in letters almost big \\r\\nenough to be legible across the room. It was an inconceiv\\x02ably stupid thing to have done. But, he realized, even in his \\r\\npanic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by \\r\\nshutting the book while the ink was wet.\\r\\nHe drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly \\r\\na warm wave of relief flowed through him. A colourless, \\r\\ncrushed-looking woman, with wispy hair and a lined face, \\r\\nwas standing outside.\\r\\n‘Oh, comrade,’ she began in a dreary, whining sort of \\r\\nvoice, ‘I thought I heard you come in. Do you think you \\r\\ncould come across and have a look at our kitchen sink? It’s \\r\\ngot blocked up and——’\\r\\nIt was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same \\r\\nfloor. (’Mrs’ was a word somewhat discountenanced by the \\r\\nParty—you were supposed to call everyone ‘comrade’—\\r\\nbut with some women one used it instinctively.) She was \\r\\na woman of about thirty, but looking much older. One had \\r\\nthe impression that there was dust in the creases of her face. \\r\\nWinston followed her down the passage. These amateur re\\x02pair jobs were an almost daily irritation. Victory Mansions \\r\\nwere old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were falling \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 27\\r\\nto pieces. The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and \\r\\nwalls, the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked \\r\\nwhenever there was snow, the heating system was usually \\r\\nrunning at half steam when it was not closed down alto\\x02gether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what you \\r\\ncould do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote com\\x02mittees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a \\r\\nwindow-pane for two years.\\r\\n‘Of course it’s only because Tom isn’t home,’ said Mrs \\r\\nParsons vaguely.\\r\\nThe Parsons’ flat was bigger than Winston’s, and dingy \\r\\nin a different way. Everything had a battered, trampled-on \\r\\nlook, as though the place had just been visited by some large \\r\\nviolent animal. Games impedimenta—hockey-sticks, box\\x02ing-gloves, a burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turned \\r\\ninside out—lay all over the floor, and on the table there was \\r\\na litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books. On \\r\\nthe walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the \\r\\nSpies, and a full-sized poster of Big Brother. There was the \\r\\nusual boiled-cabbage smell, common to the whole building, \\r\\nbut it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat, which—\\r\\none knew this at the first sniff, though it was hard to say \\r\\nhow—was the sweat of some person not present at the mo\\x02ment. In another room someone with a comb and a piece of \\r\\ntoilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music \\r\\nwhich was still issuing from the telescreen.\\r\\n‘It’s the children,’ said Mrs Parsons, casting a half-ap\\x02prehensive glance at the door. ‘They haven’t been out today. \\r\\nAnd of course——’\\n28 1984\\r\\nShe had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the mid\\x02dle. The kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy \\r\\ngreenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage. \\r\\nWinston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the \\r\\npipe. He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, \\r\\nwhich was always liable to start him coughing. Mrs Parsons \\r\\nlooked on helplessly.\\r\\n‘Of course if Tom was home he’d put it right in a mo\\x02ment,’ she said. ‘He loves anything like that. He’s ever so \\r\\ngood with his hands, Tom is.’\\r\\nParsons was Winston’s fellow-employee at the Minis\\x02try of Truth. He was a fattish but active man of paralysing \\r\\nstupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms—one of those \\r\\ncompletely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, \\r\\nmore even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the \\r\\nParty depended. At thirty-five he had just been unwilling\\x02ly evicted from the Youth League, and before graduating \\r\\ninto the Youth League he had managed to stay on in the \\r\\nSpies for a year beyond the statutory age. At the Ministry \\r\\nhe was employed in some subordinate post for which in\\x02telligence was not required, but on the other hand he was \\r\\na leading figure on the Sports Committee and all the other \\r\\ncommittees engaged in organizing community hikes, spon\\x02taneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary \\r\\nactivities generally. He would inform you with quiet pride, \\r\\nbetween whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance \\r\\nat the Community Centre every evening for the past four \\r\\nyears. An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of uncon\\x02scious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 29\\r\\nhim about wherever he went, and even remained behind \\r\\nhim after he had gone.\\r\\n‘Have you got a spanner?’ said Winston, fiddling with the \\r\\nnut on the angle-joint.\\r\\n‘A spanner,’ said Mrs Parsons, immediately becoming \\r\\ninvertebrate. ‘I don’t know, I’m sure. Perhaps the children—\\r\\n—’\\r\\nThere was a trampling of boots and another blast on the \\r\\ncomb as the children charged into the living-room. Mrs \\r\\nParsons brought the spanner. Winston let out the water \\r\\nand disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had \\r\\nblocked up the pipe. He cleaned his fingers as best he could \\r\\nin the cold water from the tap and went back into the other \\r\\nroom.\\r\\n‘Up with your hands!’ yelled a savage voice.\\r\\nA handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up \\r\\nfrom behind the table and was menacing him with a toy \\r\\nautomatic pistol, while his small sister, about two years \\r\\nyounger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood. \\r\\nBoth of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, \\r\\nand red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies. \\r\\nWinston raised his hands above his head, but with an un\\x02easy feeling, so vicious was the boy’s demeanour, that it was \\r\\nnot altogether a game.\\r\\n‘You’re a traitor!’ yelled the boy. ‘You’re a thought-crimi\\x02nal! You’re a Eurasian spy! I’ll shoot you, I’ll vaporize you, \\r\\nI’ll send you to the salt mines!’\\r\\nSuddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting \\r\\n‘Traitor!’ and ‘Thought-criminal!’ the little girl imitating \\n30 1984\\r\\nher brother in every movement. It was somehow slightly \\r\\nfrightening, like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will \\r\\nsoon grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort of calculat\\x02ing ferocity in the boy’s eye, a quite evident desire to hit or \\r\\nkick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big \\r\\nenough to do so. It was a good job it was not a real pistol he \\r\\nwas holding, Winston thought.\\r\\nMrs Parsons’ eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the \\r\\nchildren, and back again. In the better light of the living\\x02room he noticed with interest that there actually was dust \\r\\nin the creases of her face.\\r\\n‘They do get so noisy,’ she said. ‘They’re disappointed \\r\\nbecause they couldn’t go to see the hanging, that’s what it \\r\\nis. I’m too busy to take them. and Tom won’t be back from \\r\\nwork in time.’\\r\\n‘Why can’t we go and see the hanging?’ roared the boy in \\r\\nhis huge voice.\\r\\n‘Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!’ \\r\\nchanted the little girl, still capering round.\\r\\nSome Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to \\r\\nbe hanged in the Park that evening, Winston remembered. \\r\\nThis happened about once a month, and was a popular spec\\x02tacle. Children always clamoured to be taken to see it. He \\r\\ntook his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door. But he \\r\\nhad not gone six steps down the passage when something \\r\\nhit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow. It was \\r\\nas though a red-hot wire had been jabbed into him. He spun \\r\\nround just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her son back \\r\\ninto the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 31\\r\\n‘Goldstein!’ bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. \\r\\nBut what most struck Winston was the look of helpless \\r\\nfright on the woman’s greyish face.\\r\\nBack in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen \\r\\nand sat down at the table again, still rubbing his neck. The \\r\\nmusic from the telescreen had stopped. Instead, a clipped \\r\\nmilitary voice was reading out, with a sort of brutal relish, \\r\\na description of the armaments of the new Floating For\\x02tress which had just been anchored between Iceland and \\r\\nthe Faroe lslands.\\r\\nWith those children, he thought, that wretched wom\\x02an must lead a life of terror. Another year, two years, and \\r\\nthey would be watching her night and day for symptoms of \\r\\nunorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. \\r\\nWhat was worst of all was that by means of such organi\\x02zations as the Spies they were systematically turned into \\r\\nungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them \\r\\nno tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the \\r\\nParty. On the contrary, they adored the Party and every\\x02thing connected with it. The songs, the processions, the \\r\\nbanners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the \\r\\nyelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother—it was all a \\r\\nsort of glorious game to them. All their ferocity was turned \\r\\noutwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreign\\x02ers, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost \\r\\nnormal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own \\r\\nchildren. And with good reason, for hardly a week passed \\r\\nin which ‘The Times’ did not carry a paragraph describing \\r\\nhow some eavesdropping little sneak—’child hero’ was the \\n32 1984\\r\\nphrase generally used—had overheard some compromising \\r\\nremark and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.\\r\\nThe sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked \\r\\nup his pen half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find \\r\\nsomething more to write in the diary. Suddenly he began \\r\\nthinking of O’Brien again.\\r\\nYears ago—how long was it? Seven years it must be—he \\r\\nhad dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-dark \\r\\nroom. And someone sitting to one side of him had said as \\r\\nhe passed: ‘We shall meet in the place where there is no \\r\\ndarkness.’ It was said very quietly, almost casually—a state\\x02ment, not a command. He had walked on without pausing. \\r\\nWhat was curious was that at the time, in the dream, the \\r\\nwords had not made much impression on him. It was only \\r\\nlater and by degrees that they had seemed to take on signifi\\x02cance. He could not now remember whether it was before \\r\\nor after having the dream that he had seen O’Brien for the \\r\\nfirst time, nor could he remember when he had first identi\\x02fied the voice as O’Brien’s. But at any rate the identification \\r\\nexisted. It was O’Brien who had spoken to him out of the \\r\\ndark.\\r\\nWinston had never been able to feel sure—even after this \\r\\nmorning’s flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure \\r\\nwhether O’Brien was a friend or an enemy. Nor did it even \\r\\nseem to matter greatly. There was a link of understanding \\r\\nbetween them, more important than affection or partisan\\x02ship. ‘We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,’ \\r\\nhe had said. Winston did not know what it meant, only that \\r\\nin some way or another it would come true.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 33\\r\\nThe voice from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call, \\r\\nclear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air. The voice \\r\\ncontinued raspingly:\\r\\n’Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has this \\r\\nmoment arrived from the Malabar front. Our forces in South \\r\\nIndia have won a glorious victory. I am authorized to say \\r\\nthat the action we are now reporting may well bring the war \\r\\nwithin measurable distance of its end. Here is the newsflash—\\r\\n—’\\r\\nBad news coming, thought Winston. And sure enough, \\r\\nfollowing on a gory description of the annihilation of a \\r\\nEurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and pris\\x02oners, came the announcement that, as from next week, the \\r\\nchocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to \\r\\ntwenty.\\r\\nWinston belched again. The gin was wearing off, leaving \\r\\na deflated feeling. The telescreen—perhaps to celebrate the \\r\\nvictory, perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate—\\r\\ncrashed into ‘Oceania, ‘tis for thee’. You were supposed to \\r\\nstand to attention. However, in his present position he was \\r\\ninvisible.\\r\\n‘Oceania, ‘tis for thee’ gave way to lighter music. Win\\x02ston walked over to the window, keeping his back to the \\r\\ntelescreen. The day was still cold and clear. Somewhere far \\r\\naway a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating \\r\\nroar. About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on \\r\\nLondon at present.\\n34 1984\\r\\nDown in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to \\r\\nand fro, and the word INGSOC fitfully appeared and van\\x02ished. Ingsoc. The sacred principles of Ingsoc. Newspeak, \\r\\ndoublethink, the mutability of the past. He felt as though \\r\\nhe were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in \\r\\na monstrous world where he himself was the monster. He \\r\\nwas alone. The past was dead, the future was unimaginable. \\r\\nWhat certainty had he that a single human creature now \\r\\nliving was on his side? And what way of knowing that the \\r\\ndominion of the Party would not endure FOR EVER? Like \\r\\nan answer, the three slogans on the white face of the Minis\\x02try of Truth came back to him:\\r\\nWAR IS PEACE \\r\\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY \\r\\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\\r\\nHe took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket. There, \\r\\ntoo, in tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, \\r\\nand on the other face of the coin the head of Big Broth\\x02er. Even from the coin the eyes pursued you. On coins, on \\r\\nstamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and \\r\\non the wrappings of a cigarette packet—everywhere. Al\\x02ways the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you. \\r\\nAsleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors, \\r\\nin the bath or in bed—no escape. Nothing was your own ex\\x02cept the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.\\r\\nThe sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of \\r\\nthe Ministry of Truth, with the light no longer shining on \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 35\\r\\nthem, looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress. His heart \\r\\nquailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. It was too \\r\\nstrong, it could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs \\r\\nwould not batter it down. He wondered again for whom he \\r\\nwas writing the diary. For the future, for the past—for an \\r\\nage that might be imaginary. And in front of him there lay \\r\\nnot death but annihilation. The diary would be reduced \\r\\nto ashes and himself to vapour. Only the Thought Police \\r\\nwould read what he had written, before they wiped it out of \\r\\nexistence and out of memory. How could you make appeal \\r\\nto the future when not a trace of you, not even an anony\\x02mous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically \\r\\nsurvive?\\r\\nThe telescreen struck fourteen. He must leave in ten min\\x02utes. He had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty.\\r\\nCuriously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put \\r\\nnew heart into him. He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth \\r\\nthat nobody would ever hear. But so long as he uttered it, \\r\\nin some obscure way the continuity was not broken. It was \\r\\nnot by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you \\r\\ncarried on the human heritage. He went back to the table, \\r\\ndipped his pen, and wrote:\\r\\nTo the future or to the past, to a time when thought is \\r\\nfree, when men are different from one another and do not \\r\\nlive alone—to a time when truth exists and what is done \\r\\ncannot be undone: From the age of uniformity, from the \\r\\nage of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age of \\r\\ndoublethink—greetings!\\n36 1984\\r\\nHe was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that \\r\\nit was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate \\r\\nhis thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step. The conse\\x02quences of every act are included in the act itself. He wrote:\\r\\nThoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.\\r\\nNow he had recognized himself as a dead man it became \\r\\nimportant to stay alive as long as possible. Two fingers of his \\r\\nright hand were inkstained. It was exactly the kind of detail \\r\\nthat might betray you. Some nosing zealot in the Ministry \\r\\n(a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-haired \\r\\nwoman or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Depart\\x02ment) might start wondering why he had been writing \\r\\nduring the lunch interval, why he had used an old-fash\\x02ioned pen, WHAT he had been writing—and then drop a \\r\\nhint in the appropriate quarter. He went to the bathroom \\r\\nand carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty dark\\x02brown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was \\r\\ntherefore well adapted for this purpose.\\r\\nHe put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite useless \\r\\nto think of hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether \\r\\nor not its existence had been discovered. A hair laid across \\r\\nthe page-ends was too obvious. With the tip of his finger he \\r\\npicked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and depos\\x02ited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be \\r\\nshaken off if the book was moved.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 37\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\nWinston was dreaming of his mother.\\r\\nHe must, he thought, have been ten or elev\\x02en years old when his mother had disappeared. She was \\r\\na tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow move\\x02ments and magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered \\r\\nmore vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark \\r\\nclothes (Winston remembered especially the very thin soles \\r\\nof his father’s shoes) and wearing spectacles. The two of \\r\\nthem must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the \\r\\nfirst great purges of the fifties.\\r\\nAt this moment his mother was sitting in some place \\r\\ndeep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms. \\r\\nHe did not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble \\r\\nbaby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes. Both of them \\r\\nwere looking up at him. They were down in some subter\\x02ranean place—the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very \\r\\ndeep grave—but it was a place which, already far below him, \\r\\nwas itself moving downwards. They were in the saloon of \\r\\na sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening \\r\\nwater. There was still air in the saloon, they could still see \\r\\nhim and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, \\r\\ndown into the green waters which in another moment must \\r\\nhide them from sight for ever. He was out in the light and \\r\\nair while they were being sucked down to death, and they \\n38 1984\\r\\nwere down there because he was up here. He knew it and \\r\\nthey knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. \\r\\nThere was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, \\r\\nonly the knowledge that they must die in order that he \\r\\nmight remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoid\\x02able order of things.\\r\\nHe could not remember what had happened, but he knew \\r\\nin his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and \\r\\nhis sister had been sacrificed to his own. It was one of those \\r\\ndreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream \\r\\nscenery, are a continuation of one’s intellectual life, and \\r\\nin which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still \\r\\nseem new and valuable after one is awake. The thing that \\r\\nnow suddenly struck Winston was that his mother’s death, \\r\\nnearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a \\r\\nway that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, be\\x02longed to the ancient time, to a time when there was still \\r\\nprivacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of a \\r\\nfamily stood by one another without needing to know the \\r\\nreason. His mother’s memory tore at his heart because she \\r\\nhad died loving him, when he was too young and selfish \\r\\nto love her in return, and because somehow, he did not re\\x02member how, she had sacrificed herself to a conception of \\r\\nloyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he \\r\\nsaw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, \\r\\nand pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex \\r\\nsorrows. All this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his \\r\\nmother and his sister, looking up at him through the green \\r\\nwater, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 39\\r\\nSuddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a \\r\\nsummer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded \\r\\nthe ground. The landscape that he was looking at recurred \\r\\nso often in his dreams that he was never fully certain \\r\\nwhether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his wak\\x02ing thoughts he called it the Golden Country. It was an old, \\r\\nrabbit-bitten pasture, with a foot-track wandering across it \\r\\nand a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the \\r\\nopposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were \\r\\nswaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring \\r\\nin dense masses like women’s hair. Somewhere near at hand, \\r\\nthough out of sight, there was a clear, slow-moving stream \\r\\nwhere dace were swimming in the pools under the willow \\r\\ntrees.\\r\\nThe girl with dark hair was coming towards them across \\r\\nthe field. With what seemed a single movement she tore off \\r\\nher clothes and flung them disdainfully aside. Her body \\r\\nwas white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him, in\\x02deed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that \\r\\ninstant was admiration for the gesture with which she had \\r\\nthrown her clothes aside. With its grace and carelessness \\r\\nit seemed to annihilate a whole culture, a whole system \\r\\nof thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the \\r\\nThought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a sin\\x02gle splendid movement of the arm. That too was a gesture \\r\\nbelonging to the ancient time. Winston woke up with the \\r\\nword ‘Shakespeare’ on his lips.\\r\\nThe telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle \\r\\nwhich continued on the same note for thirty seconds. It \\n40 1984\\r\\nwas nought seven fifteen, getting-up time for office workers. \\r\\nWinston wrenched his body out of bed—naked, for a mem\\x02ber of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons \\r\\nannually, and a suit of pyjamas was 600—and seized a din\\x02gy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair. \\r\\nThe Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes. The next \\r\\nmoment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which \\r\\nnearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied \\r\\nhis lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing \\r\\nagain by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps. \\r\\nHis veins had swelled with the effort of the cough, and the \\r\\nvaricose ulcer had started itching.\\r\\n‘Thirty to forty group!’ yapped a piercing female voice. \\r\\n‘Thirty to forty group! Take your places, please. Thirties to \\r\\nforties!’\\r\\nWinston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, \\r\\nupon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny but \\r\\nmuscular, dressed in tunic and gym-shoes, had already ap\\x02peared.\\r\\n‘Arms bending and stretching!’ she rapped out. ‘Take \\r\\nyour time by me. ONE, two, three, four! ONE, two, three, \\r\\nfour! Come on, comrades, put a bit of life into it! ONE, two, \\r\\nthree four! ONE two, three, four!...’\\r\\nThe pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of \\r\\nWinston’s mind the impression made by his dream, and the \\r\\nrhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat. \\r\\nAs he mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearing \\r\\non his face the look of grim enjoyment which was consid\\x02ered proper during the Physical Jerks, he was struggling \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 41\\r\\nto think his way backward into the dim period of his early \\r\\nchildhood. It was extraordinarily difficult. Beyond the late \\r\\nfifties everything faded. When there were no external re\\x02cords that you could refer to, even the outline of your own \\r\\nlife lost its sharpness. You remembered huge events which \\r\\nhad quite probably not happened, you remembered the \\r\\ndetail of incidents without being able to recapture their at\\x02mosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you \\r\\ncould assign nothing. Everything had been different then. \\r\\nEven the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, \\r\\nhad been different. Airstrip One, for instance, had not been \\r\\nso called in those days: it had been called England or Brit\\x02ain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been \\r\\ncalled London.\\r\\nWinston could not definitely remember a time when his \\r\\ncountry had not been at war, but it was evident that there \\r\\nhad been a fairly long interval of peace during his child\\x02hood, because one of his early memories was of an air raid \\r\\nwhich appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was \\r\\nthe time when the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester. \\r\\nHe did not remember the raid itself, but he did remember \\r\\nhis father’s hand clutching his own as they hurried down, \\r\\ndown, down into some place deep in the earth, round and \\r\\nround a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which \\r\\nfinally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and \\r\\nthey had to stop and rest. His mother, in her slow, dreamy \\r\\nway, was following a long way behind them. She was car\\x02rying his baby sister—or perhaps it was only a bundle of \\r\\nblankets that she was carrying: he was not certain whether \\n42 1984\\r\\nhis sister had been born then. Finally they had emerged into \\r\\na noisy, crowded place which he had realized to be a Tube \\r\\nstation.\\r\\nThere were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, \\r\\nand other people, packed tightly together, were sitting on \\r\\nmetal bunks, one above the other. Winston and his mother \\r\\nand father found themselves a place on the floor, and near \\r\\nthem an old man and an old woman were sitting side by \\r\\nside on a bunk. The old man had on a decent dark suit and \\r\\na black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair: his \\r\\nface was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears. He \\r\\nreeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place \\r\\nof sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears welling \\r\\nfrom his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly drunk he \\r\\nwas also suffering under some grief that was genuine and \\r\\nunbearable. In his childish way Winston grasped that some \\r\\nterrible thing, something that was beyond forgiveness and \\r\\ncould never be remedied, had just happened. It also seemed \\r\\nto him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the old \\r\\nman loved—a little granddaughter, perhaps—had been \\r\\nkilled. Every few minutes the old man kept repeating:\\r\\n’We didn’t ought to ‘ave trusted ‘em. I said so, Ma, didn’t I? \\r\\nThat’s what comes of trusting ‘em. I said so all along. We \\r\\ndidn’t ought to ‘ave trusted the buggers.’\\r\\nBut which buggers they didn’t ought to have trusted \\r\\nWinston could not now remember.\\r\\nSince about that time, war had been literally continu-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 43\\r\\nous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the \\r\\nsame war. For several months during his childhood there \\r\\nhad been confused street fighting in London itself, some of \\r\\nwhich he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history \\r\\nof the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any \\r\\ngiven moment, would have been utterly impossible, since \\r\\nno written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention \\r\\nof any other alignment than the existing one. At this mo\\x02ment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at \\r\\nwar with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no pub\\x02lic or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three \\r\\npowers had at any time been grouped along different lines. \\r\\nActually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since \\r\\nOceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with \\r\\nEurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge \\r\\nwhich he happened to possess because his memory was not \\r\\nsatisfactorily under control. Officially the change of part\\x02ners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: \\r\\ntherefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The \\r\\nenemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and \\r\\nit followed that any past or future agreement with him was \\r\\nimpossible.\\r\\nThe frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thou\\x02sandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward \\r\\n(with hands on hips, they were gyrating their bodies from \\r\\nthe waist, an exercise that was supposed to be good for the \\r\\nback muscles)—the frightening thing was that it might all \\r\\nbe true. If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and \\r\\nsay of this or that event, IT NEVER HAPPENED—that, \\n44 1984\\r\\nsurely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death?\\r\\nThe Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance \\r\\nwith Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had \\r\\nbeen in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years \\r\\nago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own \\r\\nconsciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. \\r\\nAnd if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed—\\r\\nif all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into \\r\\nhistory and became truth. ‘Who controls the past,’ ran the \\r\\nParty slogan, ‘controls the future: who controls the present \\r\\ncontrols the past.’ And yet the past, though of its nature al\\x02terable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was \\r\\ntrue from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All \\r\\nthat was needed was an unending series of victories over \\r\\nyour own memory. ‘Reality control’, they called it: in New\\x02speak, ‘doublethink’.\\r\\n‘Stand easy!’ barked the instructress, a little more genial\\x02ly.\\r\\nWinston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled \\r\\nhis lungs with air. His mind slid away into the labyrin\\x02thine world of doublethink. To know and not to know, to \\r\\nbe conscious of complete truthfulness while telling care\\x02fully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions \\r\\nwhich cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory \\r\\nand believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, \\r\\nto repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe \\r\\nthat democracy was impossible and that the Party was the \\r\\nguardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary \\r\\nto forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 45\\r\\nmoment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget \\r\\nit again: and above all, to apply the same process to the pro\\x02cess itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to \\r\\ninduce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become \\r\\nunconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. \\r\\nEven to understand the word ‘doublethink’ involved the \\r\\nuse of doublethink.\\r\\nThe instructress had called them to attention again. ‘And \\r\\nnow let’s see which of us can touch our toes!’ she said en\\x02thusiastically. ‘Right over from the hips, please, comrades. \\r\\nONE-two! ONE-two!...’\\r\\nWinston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains \\r\\nall the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by \\r\\nbringing on another coughing fit. The half-pleasant qual\\x02ity went out of his meditations. The past, he reflected, had \\r\\nnot merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. For \\r\\nhow could you establish even the most obvious fact when \\r\\nthere existed no record outside your own memory? He tried \\r\\nto remember in what year he had first heard mention of \\r\\nBig Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in \\r\\nthe sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party \\r\\nhistories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and \\r\\nguardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His \\r\\nexploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until \\r\\nalready they extended into the fabulous world of the forties \\r\\nand the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylin\\x02drical hats still rode through the streets of London in great \\r\\ngleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides. \\r\\nThere was no knowing how much of this legend was true \\n46 1984\\r\\nand how much invented. Winston could not even remem\\x02ber at what date the Party itself had come into existence. He \\r\\ndid not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before \\r\\n1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak form—’Eng\\x02lish Socialism’, that is to say—it had been current earlier. \\r\\nEverything melted into mist. Sometimes, indeed, you could \\r\\nput your finger on a definite lie. It was not true, for example, \\r\\nas was claimed in the Party history books, that the Party \\r\\nhad invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since \\r\\nhis earliest childhood. But you could prove nothing. There \\r\\nwas never any evidence. Just once in his whole life he had \\r\\nheld in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the \\r\\nfalsification of an historical fact. And on that occasion——\\r\\n‘Smith!’ screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. \\r\\n‘6079 Smith W.! Yes, YOU! Bend lower, please! You can do \\r\\nbetter than that. You’re not trying. Lower, please! THAT’S \\r\\nbetter, comrade. Now stand at ease, the whole squad, and \\r\\nwatch me.’\\r\\nA sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston’s \\r\\nbody. His face remained completely inscrutable. Nev\\x02er show dismay! Never show resentment! A single flicker \\r\\nof the eyes could give you away. He stood watching while \\r\\nthe instructress raised her arms above her head and—one \\r\\ncould not say gracefully, but with remarkable neatness and \\r\\nefficiency—bent over and tucked the first joint of her fin\\x02gers under her toes.\\r\\n‘THERE, comrades! THAT’S how I want to see you do\\x02ing it. Watch me again. I’m thirty-nine and I’ve had four \\r\\nchildren. Now look.’ She bent over again. ‘You see MY \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 47\\r\\nknees aren’t bent. You can all do it if you want to,’ she add\\x02ed as she straightened herself up. ‘Anyone under forty-five \\r\\nis perfectly capable of touching his toes. We don’t all have \\r\\nthe privilege of fighting in the front line, but at least we can \\r\\nall keep fit. Remember our boys on the Malabar front! And \\r\\nthe sailors in the Floating Fortresses! Just think what THEY \\r\\nhave to put up with. Now try again. That’s better, comrade, \\r\\nthat’s MUCH better,’ she added encouragingly as Winston, \\r\\nwith a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with \\r\\nknees unbent, for the first time in several years.\\n48 1984\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\nWith the deep, unconscious sigh which not even the \\r\\nnearness of the telescreen could prevent him from \\r\\nuttering when his day’s work started, Winston pulled the \\r\\nspeakwrite towards him, blew the dust from its mouthpiece, \\r\\nand put on his spectacles. Then he unrolled and clipped \\r\\ntogether four small cylinders of paper which had already \\r\\nflopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side \\r\\nof his desk.\\r\\nIn the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To \\r\\nthe right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for writ\\x02ten messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in \\r\\nthe side wall, within easy reach of Winston’s arm, a large \\r\\noblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for the \\r\\ndisposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or \\r\\ntens of thousands throughout the building, not only in ev\\x02ery room but at short intervals in every corridor. For some \\r\\nreason they were nicknamed memory holes. When one \\r\\nknew that any document was due for destruction, or even \\r\\nwhen one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an \\r\\nautomatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole \\r\\nand drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a \\r\\ncurrent of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were \\r\\nhidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.\\r\\nWinston examined the four slips of paper which he had \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 49\\r\\nunrolled. Each contained a message of only one or two lines, \\r\\nin the abbreviated jargon—not actually Newspeak, but con\\x02sisting largely of Newspeak words—which was used in the \\r\\nMinistry for internal purposes. They ran:\\r\\ntimes 17.3.84 bb speech malreported africa rectify\\r\\ntimes 19.12.83 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify \\r\\ncurrent issue\\r\\ntimes 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify\\r\\ntimes 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs \\r\\nunpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling\\r\\nWith a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the \\r\\nfourth message aside. It was an intricate and responsible job \\r\\nand had better be dealt with last. The other three were rou\\x02tine matters, though the second one would probably mean \\r\\nsome tedious wading through lists of figures.\\r\\nWinston dialled ‘back numbers’ on the telescreen and \\r\\ncalled for the appropriate issues of ‘The Times’, which slid \\r\\nout of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes’ delay. \\r\\nThe messages he had received referred to articles or news \\r\\nitems which for one reason or another it was thought neces\\x02sary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. For \\r\\nexample, it appeared from ‘The Times’ of the seventeenth \\r\\nof March that Big Brother, in his speech of the previous \\r\\nday, had predicted that the South Indian front would re\\x02main quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be \\n50 1984\\r\\nlaunched in North Africa. As it happened, the Eurasian \\r\\nHigher Command had launched its offensive in South In\\x02dia and left North Africa alone. It was therefore necessary \\r\\nto rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother’s speech, in such a \\r\\nway as to make him predict the thing that had actually hap\\x02pened. Or again, ‘The Times’ of the nineteenth of December \\r\\nhad published the official forecasts of the output of various \\r\\nclasses of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983, \\r\\nwhich was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year \\r\\nPlan. Today’s issue contained a statement of the actual out\\x02put, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every \\r\\ninstance grossly wrong. Winston’s job was to rectify the \\r\\noriginal figures by making them agree with the later ones. \\r\\nAs for the third message, it referred to a very simple error \\r\\nwhich could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short a \\r\\ntime ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a \\r\\npromise (a ‘categorical pledge’ were the official words) that \\r\\nthere would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during \\r\\n1984. Actually, as Winston was aware, the chocolate ration \\r\\nwas to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end \\r\\nof the present week. All that was needed was to substitute \\r\\nfor the original promise a warning that it would probably \\r\\nbe necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.\\r\\nAs soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, \\r\\nhe clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate \\r\\ncopy of ‘The Times’ and pushed them into the pneumatic \\r\\ntube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as possi\\x02ble unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and \\r\\nany notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 51\\r\\nthe memory hole to be devoured by the flames.\\r\\nWhat happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the \\r\\npneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did \\r\\nknow in general terms. As soon as all the corrections which \\r\\nhappened to be necessary in any particular number of ‘The \\r\\nTimes’ had been assembled and collated, that number would \\r\\nbe reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected \\r\\ncopy placed on the files in its stead. This process of con\\x02tinuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but \\r\\nto books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, \\r\\nsound-tracks, cartoons, photographs—to every kind of lit\\x02erature or documentation which might conceivably hold \\r\\nany political or ideological significance. Day by day and \\r\\nalmost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. \\r\\nIn this way every prediction made by the Party could be \\r\\nshown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor \\r\\nwas any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which \\r\\nconflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to \\r\\nremain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped \\r\\nclean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary. In \\r\\nno case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, \\r\\nto prove that any falsification had taken place. The largest \\r\\nsection of the Records Department, far larger than the one \\r\\non which Winston worked, consisted simply of persons \\r\\nwhose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of \\r\\nbooks, newspapers, and other documents which had been \\r\\nsuperseded and were due for destruction. A number of ‘The \\r\\nTimes’ which might, because of changes in political align\\x02ment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother, have \\n52 1984\\r\\nbeen rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing \\r\\nits original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. \\r\\nBooks, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, \\r\\nand were invariably reissued without any admission that \\r\\nany alteration had been made. Even the written instruc\\x02tions which Winston received, and which he invariably got \\r\\nrid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or \\r\\nimplied that an act of forgery was to be committed: always \\r\\nthe reference was to slips, errors, misprints, or misquota\\x02tions which it was necessary to put right in the interests of \\r\\naccuracy.\\r\\nBut actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry \\r\\nof Plenty’s figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the \\r\\nsubstitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of \\r\\nthe material that you were dealing with had no connexion \\r\\nwith anything in the real world, not even the kind of con\\x02nexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just \\r\\nas much a fantasy in their original version as in their recti\\x02fied version. A great deal of the time you were expected to \\r\\nmake them up out of your head. For example, the Minis\\x02try of Plenty’s forecast had estimated the output of boots \\r\\nfor the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was \\r\\ngiven as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting \\r\\nthe forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, \\r\\nso as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been \\r\\noverfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no near\\x02er the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions. \\r\\nVery likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, \\r\\nnobody knew how many had been produced, much less \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 53\\r\\ncared. All one knew was that every quarter astronomical \\r\\nnumbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps \\r\\nhalf the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was \\r\\nwith every class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything \\r\\nfaded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the \\r\\ndate of the year had become uncertain.\\r\\nWinston glanced across the hall. In the corresponding \\r\\ncubicle on the other side a small, precise-looking, dark\\x02chinned man named Tillotson was working steadily away, \\r\\nwith a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very \\r\\nclose to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the air of \\r\\ntrying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself \\r\\nand the telescreen. He looked up, and his spectacles darted \\r\\na hostile flash in Winston’s direction.\\r\\nWinston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what \\r\\nwork he was employed on. People in the Records Depart\\x02ment did not readily talk about their jobs. In the long, \\r\\nwindowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its end\\x02less rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into \\r\\nspeakwrites, there were quite a dozen people whom Win\\x02ston did not even know by name, though he daily saw them \\r\\nhurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the \\r\\nTwo Minutes Hate. He knew that in the cubicle next to him \\r\\nthe little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out, sim\\x02ply at tracking down and deleting from the Press the names \\r\\nof people who had been vaporized and were therefore con\\x02sidered never to have existed. There was a certain fitness in \\r\\nthis, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple \\r\\nof years earlier. And a few cubicles away a mild, ineffec-\\n54 1984\\r\\ntual, dreamy creature named Ampleforth, with very hairy \\r\\nears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and \\r\\nmetres, was engaged in producing garbled versions—defin\\x02itive texts, they were called—of poems which had become \\r\\nideologically offensive, but which for one reason or another \\r\\nwere to be retained in the anthologies. And this hall, with \\r\\nits fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a \\r\\nsingle cell, as it were, in the huge complexity of the Records \\r\\nDepartment. Beyond, above, below, were other swarms \\r\\nof workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. \\r\\nThere were the huge printing-shops with their sub-editors, \\r\\ntheir typography experts, and their elaborately equipped \\r\\nstudios for the faking of photographs. There was the tele\\x02programmes section with its engineers, its producers, and \\r\\nits teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitat\\x02ing voices. There were the armies of reference clerks whose \\r\\njob was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals \\r\\nwhich were due for recall. There were the vast repositories \\r\\nwhere the corrected documents were stored, and the hid\\x02den furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. And \\r\\nsomewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the di\\x02recting brains who co-ordinated the whole effort and laid \\r\\ndown the lines of policy which made it necessary that this \\r\\nfragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, \\r\\nand the other rubbed out of existence.\\r\\nAnd the Records Department, after all, was itself only a \\r\\nsingle branch of the Ministry of Truth, whose primary job \\r\\nwas not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens \\r\\nof Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 55\\r\\nprogrammes, plays, novels—with every conceivable kind of \\r\\ninformation, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to \\r\\na slogan, from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from \\r\\na child’s spelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary. And the \\r\\nMinistry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of \\r\\nthe party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower \\r\\nlevel for the benefit of the proletariat. There was a whole \\r\\nchain of separate departments dealing with proletarian lit\\x02erature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here \\r\\nwere produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost \\r\\nnothing except sport, crime and astrology, sensational \\r\\nfive-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimen\\x02tal songs which were composed entirely by mechanical \\r\\nmeans on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a ver\\x02sificator. There was even a whole sub-section—Pornosec, it \\r\\nwas called in Newspeak—engaged in producing the lowest \\r\\nkind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packets \\r\\nand which no Party member, other than those who worked \\r\\non it, was permitted to look at.\\r\\nThree messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while \\r\\nWinston was working, but they were simple matters, and \\r\\nhe had disposed of them before the Two Minutes Hate in\\x02terrupted him. When the Hate was over he returned to \\r\\nhis cubicle, took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf, \\r\\npushed the speakwrite to one side, cleaned his spectacles, \\r\\nand settled down to his main job of the morning.\\r\\nWinston’s greatest pleasure in life was in his work. Most \\r\\nof it was a tedious routine, but included in it there were also \\r\\njobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in \\n56 1984\\r\\nthem as in the depths of a mathematical problem—delicate \\r\\npieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you \\r\\nexcept your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and your \\r\\nestimate of what the Party wanted you to say. Winston was \\r\\ngood at this kind of thing. On occasion he had even been \\r\\nentrusted with the rectification of ‘The Times’ leading arti\\x02cles, which were written entirely in Newspeak. He unrolled \\r\\nthe message that he had set aside earlier. It ran:\\r\\ntimes 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs \\r\\nunpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling\\r\\nIn Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be ren\\x02dered:\\r\\nThe reporting of Big Brother’s Order for the Day in ‘The Times’ \\r\\nof December 3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes \\r\\nreferences to non-existent persons. Rewrite it in full and \\r\\nsubmit your draft to higher authority before filing.\\r\\nWinston read through the offending article. Big Broth\\x02er’s Order for the Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted \\r\\nto praising the work of an organization known as FFCC, \\r\\nwhich supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors \\r\\nin the Floating Fortresses. A certain Comrade Withers, a \\r\\nprominent member of the Inner Party, had been singled out \\r\\nfor special mention and awarded a decoration, the Order of \\r\\nConspicuous Merit, Second Class.\\r\\nThree months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 57\\r\\nwith no reasons given. One could assume that Withers and \\r\\nhis associates were now in disgrace, but there had been no \\r\\nreport of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen. That \\r\\nwas to be expected, since it was unusual for political offend\\x02ers to be put on trial or even publicly denounced. The great \\r\\npurges involving thousands of people, with public trials of \\r\\ntraitors and thought-criminals who made abject confession \\r\\nof their crimes and were afterwards executed, were special \\r\\nshow-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of \\r\\nyears. More commonly, people who had incurred the dis\\x02pleasure of the Party simply disappeared and were never \\r\\nheard of again. One never had the smallest clue as to what \\r\\nhad happened to them. In some cases they might not even \\r\\nbe dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to Win\\x02ston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time \\r\\nor another.\\r\\nWinston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In the \\r\\ncubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouch\\x02ing secretively over his speakwrite. He raised his head for \\r\\na moment: again the hostile spectacle-flash. Winston won\\x02dered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the same \\r\\njob as himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece of \\r\\nwork would never be entrusted to a single person: on the \\r\\nother hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to ad\\x02mit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place. Very \\r\\nlikely as many as a dozen people were now working away \\r\\non rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said. And \\r\\npresently some master brain in the Inner Party would se\\x02lect this version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion \\n58 1984\\r\\nthe complex processes of cross-referencing that would be \\r\\nrequired, and then the chosen lie would pass into the per\\x02manent records and become truth.\\r\\nWinston did not know why Withers had been disgraced. \\r\\nPerhaps it was for corruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big \\r\\nBrother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordi\\x02nate. Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had been \\r\\nsuspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps—what was \\r\\nlikeliest of all—the thing had simply happened because \\r\\npurges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the me\\x02chanics of government. The only real clue lay in the words \\r\\n‘refs unpersons’, which indicated that Withers was already \\r\\ndead. You could not invariably assume this to be the case \\r\\nwhen people were arrested. Sometimes they were released \\r\\nand allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or \\r\\ntwo years before being executed. Very occasionally some \\r\\nperson whom you had believed dead long since would make \\r\\na ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would \\r\\nimplicate hundreds of others by his testimony before van\\x02ishing, this time for ever. Withers, however, was already an \\r\\nUNPERSON. He did not exist: he had never existed. Win\\x02ston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse \\r\\nthe tendency of Big Brother’s speech. It was better to make \\r\\nit deal with something totally unconnected with its origi\\x02nal subject.\\r\\nHe might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of \\r\\ntraitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too ob\\x02vious, while to invent a victory at the front, or some triumph \\r\\nof over-production in the Ninth Three-Year Plan, might \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 59\\r\\ncomplicate the records too much. What was needed was a \\r\\npiece of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, \\r\\nready made as it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogil\\x02vy, who had recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances. \\r\\nThere were occasions when Big Brother devoted his Order \\r\\nfor the Day to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file \\r\\nParty member whose life and death he held up as an exam\\x02ple worthy to be followed. Today he should commemorate \\r\\nComrade Ogilvy. It was true that there was no such person \\r\\nas Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple of \\r\\nfaked photographs would soon bring him into existence.\\r\\nWinston thought for a moment, then pulled the speak\\x02write towards him and began dictating in Big Brother’s \\r\\nfamiliar style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, \\r\\nbecause of a trick of asking questions and then promptly \\r\\nanswering them (’What lessons do we learn from this fact, \\r\\ncomrades? The lesson—which is also one of the fundamen\\x02tal principles of Ingsoc—that,’ etc., etc.), easy to imitate.\\r\\nAt the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys \\r\\nexcept a drum, a sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter. \\r\\nAt six—a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules—he \\r\\nhad joined the Spies, at nine he had been a troop leader. At \\r\\neleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police \\r\\nafter overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to \\r\\nhave criminal tendencies. At seventeen he had been a dis\\x02trict organizer of the Junior Anti-Sex League. At nineteen \\r\\nhe had designed a hand-grenade which had been adopted \\r\\nby the Ministry of Peace and which, at its first trial, had \\r\\nkilled thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one burst. At twen-\\n60 1984\\r\\nty-three he had perished in action. Pursued by enemy jet \\r\\nplanes while flying over the Indian Ocean with important \\r\\ndespatches, he had weighted his body with his machine gun \\r\\nand leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches \\r\\nand all—an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossible \\r\\nto contemplate without feelings of envy. Big Brother added a \\r\\nfew remarks on the purity and single-mindedness of Com\\x02rade Ogilvy’s life. He was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker, \\r\\nhad no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium, \\r\\nand had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the \\r\\ncare of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour\\x02a-day devotion to duty. He had no subjects of conversation \\r\\nexcept the principles of Ingsoc, and no aim in life except \\r\\nthe defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of \\r\\nspies, saboteurs, thoughtcriminals, and traitors generally.\\r\\nWinston debated with himself whether to award Com\\x02rade Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit: in the end he \\r\\ndecided against it because of the unnecessary cross-refer\\x02encing that it would entail.\\r\\nOnce again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. \\r\\nSomething seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson \\r\\nwas busy on the same job as himself. There was no way of \\r\\nknowing whose job would finally be adopted, but he felt a \\r\\nprofound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade \\r\\nOgilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck \\r\\nhim as curious that you could create dead men but not liv\\x02ing ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had never existed in the \\r\\npresent, now existed in the past, and when once the act of \\r\\nforgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentical-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 61\\r\\nly, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius \\r\\nCaesar.\\n62 1984\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\nI\\r\\nn the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the \\r\\nlunch queue jerked slowly forward. The room was al\\x02ready very full and deafeningly noisy. From the grille at the \\r\\ncounter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour \\r\\nmetallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of \\r\\nVictory Gin. On the far side of the room there was a small \\r\\nbar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought at \\r\\nten cents the large nip.\\r\\n‘Just the man I was looking for,’ said a voice at Winston’s \\r\\nback.\\r\\nHe turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked in \\r\\nthe Research Department. Perhaps ‘friend’ was not exact\\x02ly the right word. You did not have friends nowadays, you \\r\\nhad comrades: but there were some comrades whose society \\r\\nwas pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist, a \\r\\nspecialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was one of the enormous \\r\\nteam of experts now engaged in compiling the Eleventh \\r\\nEdition of the Newspeak Dictionary. He was a tiny creature, \\r\\nsmaller than Winston, with dark hair and large, protuber\\x02ant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed to \\r\\nsearch your face closely while he was speaking to you.\\r\\n‘I wanted to ask you whether you’d got any razor blades,’ \\r\\nhe said.\\r\\n‘Not one!’ said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. ‘I’ve \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 63\\r\\ntried all over the place. They don’t exist any longer.’\\r\\nEveryone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually he \\r\\nhad two unused ones which he was hoarding up. There \\r\\nhad been a famine of them for months past. At any given \\r\\nmoment there was some necessary article which the Par\\x02ty shops were unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons, \\r\\nsometimes it was darning wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; \\r\\nat present it was razor blades. You could only get hold of \\r\\nthem, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on the \\r\\n‘free’ market.\\r\\n‘I’ve been using the same blade for six weeks,’ he added \\r\\nuntruthfully.\\r\\nThe queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted he \\r\\nturned and faced Syme again. Each of them took a greasy \\r\\nmetal tray from a pile at the end of the counter.\\r\\n‘Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?’ said \\r\\nSyme.\\r\\n‘I was working,’ said Winston indifferently. ‘I shall see it \\r\\non the flicks, I suppose.’\\r\\n‘A very inadequate substitute,’ said Syme.\\r\\nHis mocking eyes roved over Winston’s face. ‘I know \\r\\nyou,’ the eyes seemed to say, ‘I see through you. I know very \\r\\nwell why you didn’t go to see those prisoners hanged.’ In \\r\\nan intellectual way, Syme was venomously orthodox. He \\r\\nwould talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of he\\x02licopter raids on enemy villages, and trials and confessions \\r\\nof thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the \\r\\nMinistry of Love. Talking to him was largely a matter of \\r\\ngetting him away from such subjects and entangling him, \\n64 1984\\r\\nif possible, in the technicalities of Newspeak, on which he \\r\\nwas authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his head \\r\\na little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.\\r\\n‘It was a good hanging,’ said Syme reminiscently. ‘I think \\r\\nit spoils it when they tie their feet together. I like to see them \\r\\nkicking. And above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right \\r\\nout, and blue—a quite bright blue. That’s the detail that ap\\x02peals to me.’\\r\\n‘Nex’, please!’ yelled the white-aproned prole with the la\\x02dle.\\r\\nWinston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. \\r\\nOn to each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch—a \\r\\nmetal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew, a hunk of bread, a \\r\\ncube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory Coffee, and one \\r\\nsaccharine tablet.\\r\\n‘There’s a table over there, under that telescreen,’ said \\r\\nSyme. ‘Let’s pick up a gin on the way.’\\r\\nThe gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. \\r\\nThey threaded their way across the crowded room and un\\x02packed their trays on to the metal-topped table, on one \\r\\ncorner of which someone had left a pool of stew, a filthy \\r\\nliquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston \\r\\ntook up his mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his \\r\\nnerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down. When he \\r\\nhad winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discov\\x02ered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of \\r\\nthe stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes \\r\\nof spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation \\r\\nof meat. Neither of them spoke again till they had emptied \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 65\\r\\ntheir pannikins. From the table at Winston’s left, a little \\r\\nbehind his back, someone was talking rapidly and contin\\x02uously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, \\r\\nwhich pierced the general uproar of the room.\\r\\n‘How is the Dictionary getting on?’ said Winston, raising \\r\\nhis voice to overcome the noise.\\r\\n‘Slowly,’ said Syme. ‘I’m on the adjectives. It’s fascinat\\x02ing.’\\r\\nHe had brightened up immediately at the mention of \\r\\nNewspeak. He pushed his pannikin aside, took up his hunk \\r\\nof bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other, \\r\\nand leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without \\r\\nshouting.\\r\\n‘The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,’ he said. \\r\\n‘We’re getting the language into its final shape—the shape \\r\\nit’s going to have when nobody speaks anything else. When \\r\\nwe’ve finished with it, people like you will have to learn it \\r\\nall over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job is \\r\\ninventing new words. But not a bit of it! We’re destroying \\r\\nwords—scores of them, hundreds of them, every day. We’re \\r\\ncutting the language down to the bone. The Eleventh Edi\\x02tion won’t contain a single word that will become obsolete \\r\\nbefore the year 2050.’\\r\\nHe bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple \\r\\nof mouthfuls, then continued speaking, with a sort of ped\\x02ant’s passion. His thin dark face had become animated, his \\r\\neyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost \\r\\ndreamy.\\r\\n‘It’s a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course \\n66 1984\\r\\nthe great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there \\r\\nare hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn’t \\r\\nonly the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all, \\r\\nwhat justification is there for a word which is simply the \\r\\nopposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite \\r\\nin itself. Take ‘good’, for instance. If you have a word like \\r\\n‘good’, what need is there for a word like ‘bad’? ‘Ungood’ \\r\\nwill do just as well—better, because it’s an exact opposite, \\r\\nwhich the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger ver\\x02sion of ‘good’, what sense is there in having a whole string \\r\\nof vague useless words like ‘excellent’ and ‘splendid’ and all \\r\\nthe rest of them? ‘Plusgood’ covers the meaning, or ‘double\\x02plusgood’ if you want something stronger still. Of course \\r\\nwe use those forms already. but in the final version of New\\x02speak there’ll be nothing else. In the end the whole notion \\r\\nof goodness and badness will be covered by only six words—\\r\\nin reality, only one word. Don’t you see the beauty of that, \\r\\nWinston? It was B.B.’s idea originally, of course,’ he added \\r\\nas an afterthought.\\r\\nA sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston’s face at \\r\\nthe mention of Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately \\r\\ndetected a certain lack of enthusiasm.\\r\\n‘You haven’t a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,’ \\r\\nhe said almost sadly. ‘Even when you write it you’re still \\r\\nthinking in Oldspeak. I’ve read some of those pieces that \\r\\nyou write in ‘The Times’ occasionally. They’re good enough, \\r\\nbut they’re translations. In your heart you’d prefer to stick \\r\\nto Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of \\r\\nmeaning. You don’t grasp the beauty of the destruction of \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 67\\r\\nwords. Do you know that Newspeak is the only language in \\r\\nthe world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?’\\r\\nWinston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympa\\x02thetically he hoped, not trusting himself to speak. Syme bit \\r\\noff another fragment of the dark-coloured bread, chewed it \\r\\nbriefly, and went on:\\r\\n‘Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to \\r\\nnarrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make \\r\\nthoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no \\r\\nwords in which to express it. Every concept that can ever \\r\\nbe needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its \\r\\nmeaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings \\r\\nrubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition, \\r\\nwe’re not far from that point. But the process will still be \\r\\ncontinuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer \\r\\nand fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a \\r\\nlittle smaller. Even now, of course, there’s no reason or ex\\x02cuse for committing thoughtcrime. It’s merely a question \\r\\nof self-discipline, reality-control. But in the end there won’t \\r\\nbe any need even for that. The Revolution will be com\\x02plete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and \\r\\nIngsoc is Newspeak,’ he added with a sort of mystical satis\\x02faction. ‘Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the \\r\\nyear 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will \\r\\nbe alive who could understand such a conversation as we \\r\\nare having now?’\\r\\n‘Except——’ began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.\\r\\nIt had been on the tip of his tongue to say ‘Except the \\r\\nproles,’ but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that \\n68 1984\\r\\nthis remark was not in some way unorthodox. Syme, how\\x02ever, had divined what he was about to say.\\r\\n‘The proles are not human beings,’ he said carelessly. ‘By \\r\\n2050—earlier, probably—all real knowledge of Oldspeak \\r\\nwill have disappeared. The whole literature of the past will \\r\\nhave been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, By\\x02ron—they’ll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely \\r\\nchanged into something different, but actually changed \\r\\ninto something contradictory of what they used to be. Even \\r\\nthe literature of the Party will change. Even the slogans will \\r\\nchange. How could you have a slogan like ‘freedom is slav\\x02ery’ when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The \\r\\nwhole climate of thought will be different. In fact there will \\r\\nbe no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy means \\r\\nnot thinking—not needing to think. Orthodoxy is uncon\\x02sciousness.’\\r\\nOne of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep \\r\\nconviction, Syme will be vaporized. He is too intelligent. He \\r\\nsees too clearly and speaks too plainly. The Party does not \\r\\nlike such people. One day he will disappear. It is written in \\r\\nhis face.\\r\\nWinston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned \\r\\na little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At \\r\\nthe table on his left the man with the strident voice was \\r\\nstill talking remorselessly away. A young woman who was \\r\\nperhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back \\r\\nto Winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly \\r\\nagreeing with everything that he said. From time to time \\r\\nWinston caught some such remark as ‘I think you’re so right, \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 69\\r\\nI do so agree with you’, uttered in a youthful and rather silly \\r\\nfeminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an in\\x02stant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the \\r\\nman by sight, though he knew no more about him than that \\r\\nhe held some important post in the Fiction Department. He \\r\\nwas a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a \\r\\nlarge, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and \\r\\nbecause of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles \\r\\ncaught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs \\r\\ninstead of eyes. What was slightly horrible, was that from \\r\\nthe stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was \\r\\nalmost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just once \\r\\nWinston caught a phrase—’complete and final elimination \\r\\nof Goldsteinism’—jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, \\r\\nall in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it \\r\\nwas just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though \\r\\nyou could not actually hear what the man was saying, you \\r\\ncould not be in any doubt about its general nature. He might \\r\\nbe denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures \\r\\nagainst thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be ful\\x02minating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army, he \\r\\nmight be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar \\r\\nfront—it made no difference. Whatever it was, you could \\r\\nbe certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure \\r\\nIngsoc. As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving \\r\\nrapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that \\r\\nthis was not a real human being but some kind of dummy. It \\r\\nwas not the man’s brain that was speaking, it was his larynx. \\r\\nThe stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but \\n70 1984\\r\\nit was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in \\r\\nunconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.\\r\\nSyme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the han\\x02dle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. \\r\\nThe voice from the other table quacked rapidly on, easily \\r\\naudible in spite of the surrounding din.\\r\\n‘There is a word in Newspeak,’ said Syme, ‘I don’t know \\r\\nwhether you know it: DUCKSPEAK, to quack like a duck. It \\r\\nis one of those interesting words that have two contradic\\x02tory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse, applied \\r\\nto someone you agree with, it is praise.’\\r\\nUnquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston \\r\\nthought again. He thought it with a kind of sadness, al\\x02though well knowing that Syme despised him and slightly \\r\\ndisliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as \\r\\na thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There \\r\\nwas something subtly wrong with Syme. There was some\\x02thing that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of saving \\r\\nstupidity. You could not say that he was unorthodox. He be\\x02lieved in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother, \\r\\nhe rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with \\r\\nsincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness \\r\\nof information, which the ordinary Party member did not \\r\\napproach. Yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to \\r\\nhim. He said things that would have been better unsaid, he \\r\\nhad read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut Tree \\r\\nCafe, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law, \\r\\nnot even an unwritten law, against frequenting the Chest\\x02nut Tree Cafe, yet the place was somehow ill-omened. The \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 71\\r\\nold, discredited leaders of the Party had been used to gather \\r\\nthere before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself, it \\r\\nwas said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades \\r\\nago. Syme’s fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it was \\r\\na fact that if Syme grasped, even for three seconds, the na\\x02ture of his, Winston’s, secret opinions, he would betray him \\r\\ninstantly to the Thought Police. So would anybody else, for \\r\\nthat matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was not enough. \\r\\nOrthodoxy was unconsciousness.\\r\\nSyme looked up. ‘Here comes Parsons,’ he said.\\r\\nSomething in the tone of his voice seemed to add, ‘that \\r\\nbloody fool’. Parsons, Winston’s fellow-tenant at Victory \\r\\nMansions, was in fact threading his way across the room—\\r\\na tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face. \\r\\nAt thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck \\r\\nand waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. \\r\\nHis whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so \\r\\nmuch so that although he was wearing the regulation over\\x02alls, it was almost impossible not to think of him as being \\r\\ndressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red neckerchief \\r\\nof the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a picture \\r\\nof dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy fore\\x02arms. Parsons did, indeed, invariably revert to shorts when \\r\\na community hike or any other physical activity gave him \\r\\nan excuse for doing so. He greeted them both with a cheery \\r\\n‘Hullo, hullo!’ and sat down at the table, giving off an in\\x02tense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all over \\r\\nhis pink face. His powers of sweating were extraordinary. \\r\\nAt the Community Centre you could always tell when he \\n72 1984\\r\\nhad been playing table-tennis by the dampness of the bat \\r\\nhandle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there \\r\\nwas a long column of words, and was studying it with an \\r\\nink-pencil between his fingers.\\r\\n‘Look at him working away in the lunch hour,’ said Par\\x02sons, nudging Winston. ‘Keenness, eh? What’s that you’ve \\r\\ngot there, old boy? Something a bit too brainy for me, I ex\\x02pect. Smith, old boy, I’ll tell you why I’m chasing you. It’s \\r\\nthat sub you forgot to give me.’\\r\\n‘Which sub is that?’ said Winston, automatically feel\\x02ing for money. About a quarter of one’s salary had to be \\r\\nearmarked for voluntary subscriptions, which were so nu\\x02merous that it was difficult to keep track of them.\\r\\n‘For Hate Week. You know—the house-by-house fund. \\r\\nI’m treasurer for our block. We’re making an all-out effort—\\r\\ngoing to put on a tremendous show. I tell you, it won’t be my \\r\\nfault if old Victory Mansions doesn’t have the biggest outfit \\r\\nof flags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me.’\\r\\nWinston found and handed over two creased and filthy \\r\\nnotes, which Parsons entered in a small notebook, in the \\r\\nneat handwriting of the illiterate.\\r\\n‘By the way, old boy,’ he said. ‘I hear that little beggar of \\r\\nmine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday. I gave him \\r\\na good dressing-down for it. In fact I told him I’d take the \\r\\ncatapult away if he does it again.’\\r\\n‘I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,’ \\r\\nsaid Winston.\\r\\n‘Ah, well—what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, \\r\\ndoesn’t it? Mischievous little beggars they are, both of them, \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 73\\r\\nbut talk about keenness! All they think about is the Spies, \\r\\nand the war, of course. D’you know what that little girl of \\r\\nmine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike out \\r\\nBerkhamsted way? She got two other girls to go with her, \\r\\nslipped off from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon \\r\\nfollowing a strange man. They kept on his tail for two hours, \\r\\nright through the woods, and then, when they got into Am\\x02ersham, handed him over to the patrols.’\\r\\n‘What did they do that for?’ said Winston, somewhat tak\\x02en aback. Parsons went on triumphantly:\\r\\n‘My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent—\\r\\nmight have been dropped by parachute, for instance. But \\r\\nhere’s the point, old boy. What do you think put her on to \\r\\nhim in the first place? She spotted he was wearing a funny \\r\\nkind of shoes—said she’d never seen anyone wearing shoes \\r\\nlike that before. So the chances were he was a foreigner. \\r\\nPretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?’\\r\\n‘What happened to the man?’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘Ah, that I couldn’t say, of course. But I wouldn’t be alto\\x02gether surprised if——’ Parsons made the motion of aiming \\r\\na rifle, and clicked his tongue for the explosion.\\r\\n‘Good,’ said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from \\r\\nhis strip of paper.\\r\\n‘Of course we can’t afford to take chances,’ agreed Win\\x02ston dutifully.\\r\\n‘What I mean to say, there is a war on,’ said Parsons.\\r\\nAs though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call float\\x02ed from the telescreen just above their heads. However, it \\r\\nwas not the proclamation of a military victory this time, but \\n74 1984\\r\\nmerely an announcement from the Ministry of Plenty.\\r\\n‘Comrades!’ cried an eager youthful voice. ‘Attention, \\r\\ncomrades! We have glorious news for you. We have won the \\r\\nbattle for production! Returns now completed of the output \\r\\nof all classes of consumption goods show that the standard \\r\\nof living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past \\r\\nyear. All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible \\r\\nspontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out of \\r\\nfactories and offices and paraded through the streets with \\r\\nbanners voicing their gratitude to Big Brother for the new, \\r\\nhappy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us. \\r\\nHere are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs——’\\r\\nThe phrase ‘our new, happy life’ recurred several times. It \\r\\nhad been a favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Par\\x02sons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening \\r\\nwith a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom. \\r\\nHe could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they \\r\\nwere in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged out \\r\\na huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred \\r\\ntobacco. With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it \\r\\nwas seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top. Winston was \\r\\nsmoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully hori\\x02zontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and he \\r\\nhad only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his \\r\\nears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that \\r\\nstreamed out of the telescreen. It appeared that there had \\r\\neven been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising \\r\\nthe chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And only \\r\\nyesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ra-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 75\\r\\ntion was to be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week. Was it \\r\\npossible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four \\r\\nhours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons swallowed it easily, \\r\\nwith the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature at the \\r\\nother table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a fu\\x02rious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone \\r\\nwho should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty \\r\\ngrammes. Syme, too—in some more complex way, involv\\x02ing doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, ALONE \\r\\nin the possession of a memory?\\r\\nThe fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the tele\\x02screen. As compared with last year there was more food, \\r\\nmore clothes, more houses, more furniture, more cook\\x02ing-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters, more \\r\\nbooks, more babies—more of everything except disease, \\r\\ncrime, and insanity. Year by year and minute by minute, \\r\\neverybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards. \\r\\nAs Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up his spoon \\r\\nand was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled \\r\\nacross the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pat\\x02tern. He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of \\r\\nlife. Had it always been like this? Had food always tasted \\r\\nlike this? He looked round the canteen. A low-ceilinged, \\r\\ncrowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of innu\\x02merable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed \\r\\nso close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent \\r\\nspoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, \\r\\ngrime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad \\r\\ngin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes. Al-\\n76 1984\\r\\nways in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of \\r\\nprotest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something \\r\\nthat you had a right to. It was true that he had no memories \\r\\nof anything greatly different. In any time that he could ac\\x02curately remember, there had never been quite enough to \\r\\neat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were not \\r\\nfull of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety, \\r\\nrooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to \\r\\npieces, bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tast\\x02ing, cigarettes insufficient—nothing cheap and plentiful \\r\\nexcept synthetic gin. And though, of course, it grew worse \\r\\nas one’s body aged, was it not a sign that this was NOT the \\r\\nnatural order of things, if one’s heart sickened at the dis\\x02comfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the \\r\\nstickiness of one’s socks, the lifts that never worked, the \\r\\ncold water, the gritty soap, the cigarettes that came to piec\\x02es, the food with its strange evil tastes? Why should one feel \\r\\nit to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral \\r\\nmemory that things had once been different?\\r\\nHe looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was \\r\\nugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed other\\x02wise than in the uniform blue overalls. On the far side of the \\r\\nroom, sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously beetle-like \\r\\nman was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting sus\\x02picious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought \\r\\nWinston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the \\r\\nphysical type set up by the Party as an ideal—tall muscu\\x02lar youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, \\r\\nsunburnt, carefree—existed and even predominated. Ac-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 77\\r\\ntually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people in \\r\\nAirstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured. It was curi\\x02ous how that beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: \\r\\nlittle dumpy men, growing stout very early in life, with \\r\\nshort legs, swift scuttling movements, and fat inscrutable \\r\\nfaces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to \\r\\nflourish best under the dominion of the Party.\\r\\nThe announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended \\r\\non another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music. Par\\x02sons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of \\r\\nfigures, took his pipe out of his mouth.\\r\\n‘The Ministry of Plenty’s certainly done a good job this \\r\\nyear,’ he said with a knowing shake of his head. ‘By the way, \\r\\nSmith old boy, I suppose you haven’t got any razor blades \\r\\nyou can let me have?’\\r\\n‘Not one,’ said Winston. ‘I’ve been using the same blade \\r\\nfor six weeks myself.’\\r\\n‘Ah, well—just thought I’d ask you, old boy.’\\r\\n‘Sorry,’ said Winston.\\r\\nThe quacking voice from the next table, temporarily si\\x02lenced during the Ministry’s announcement, had started up \\r\\nagain, as loud as ever. For some reason Winston suddenly \\r\\nfound himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her wispy hair \\r\\nand the dust in the creases of her face. Within two years \\r\\nthose children would be denouncing her to the Thought \\r\\nPolice. Mrs Parsons would be vaporized. Syme would be \\r\\nvaporized. Winston would be vaporized. O’Brien would \\r\\nbe vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be \\r\\nvaporized. The eyeless creature with the quacking voice \\n78 1984\\r\\nwould never be vaporized. The little beetle-like men who \\r\\nscuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of \\r\\nMinistries they, too, would never be vaporized. And the girl \\r\\nwith dark hair, the girl from the Fiction Department—she \\r\\nwould never be vaporized either. It seemed to him that he \\r\\nknew instinctively who would survive and who would per\\x02ish: though just what it was that made for survival, it was \\r\\nnot easy to say.\\r\\nAt this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with \\r\\na violent jerk. The girl at the next table had turned partly \\r\\nround and was looking at him. It was the girl with dark hair. \\r\\nShe was looking at him in a sidelong way, but with curious \\r\\nintensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked away \\r\\nagain.\\r\\nThe sweat started out on Winston’s backbone. A horri\\x02ble pang of terror went through him. It was gone almost at \\r\\nonce, but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind. Why \\r\\nwas she watching him? Why did she keep following him \\r\\nabout? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she \\r\\nhad already been at the table when he arrived, or had come \\r\\nthere afterwards. But yesterday, at any rate, during the Two \\r\\nMinutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him when \\r\\nthere was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real \\r\\nobject had been to listen to him and make sure whether he \\r\\nwas shouting loudly enough.\\r\\nHis earlier thought returned to him: probably she was \\r\\nnot actually a member of the Thought Police, but then it \\r\\nwas precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger \\r\\nof all. He did not know how long she had been looking at \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 79\\r\\nhim, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was \\r\\npossible that his features had not been perfectly under con\\x02trol. It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander \\r\\nwhen you were in any public place or within range of a tele\\x02screen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous \\r\\ntic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to \\r\\nyourself—anything that carried with it the suggestion of \\r\\nabnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to \\r\\nwear an improper expression on your face (to look incredu\\x02lous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself \\r\\na punishable offence. There was even a word for it in New\\x02speak: FACECRIME, it was called.\\r\\nThe girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after \\r\\nall she was not really following him about, perhaps it was \\r\\ncoincidence that she had sat so close to him two days run\\x02ning. His cigarette had gone out, and he laid it carefully on \\r\\nthe edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work, \\r\\nif he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the person \\r\\nat the next table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite \\r\\nlikely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love \\r\\nwithin three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted. \\r\\nSyme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in \\r\\nhis pocket. Parsons had begun talking again.\\r\\n‘Did I ever tell you, old boy,’ he said, chuckling round the \\r\\nstem of his pipe, ‘about the time when those two nippers \\r\\nof mine set fire to the old market-woman’s skirt because \\r\\nthey saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of B.B.? \\r\\nSneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of match\\x02es. Burned her quite badly, I believe. Little beggars, eh? But \\n80 1984\\r\\nkeen as mustard! That’s a first-rate training they give them \\r\\nin the Spies nowadays—better than in my day, even. What \\r\\nd’you think’s the latest thing they’ve served them out with? \\r\\nEar trumpets for listening through keyholes! My little girl \\r\\nbrought one home the other night—tried it out on our sit\\x02ting-room door, and reckoned she could hear twice as much \\r\\nas with her ear to the hole. Of course it’s only a toy, mind \\r\\nyou. Still, gives ‘em the right idea, eh?’\\r\\nAt this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. \\r\\nIt was the signal to return to work. All three men sprang to \\r\\ntheir feet to join in the struggle round the lifts, and the re\\x02maining tobacco fell out of Winston’s cigarette.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 81\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\nWinston was writing in his diary:\\r\\nIt was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a \\r\\nnarrow side-street near one of the big railway stations. She \\r\\nwas standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp \\r\\nthat hardly gave any light. She had a young face, painted \\r\\nvery thick. It was really the paint that appealed to me, the \\r\\nwhiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. Party \\r\\nwomen never paint their faces. There was nobody else in the \\r\\nstreet, and no telescreens. She said two dollars. I——\\r\\nFor the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his \\r\\neyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze \\r\\nout the vision that kept recurring. He had an almost over\\x02whelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the \\r\\ntop of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall, to kick \\r\\nover the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window—to \\r\\ndo any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black \\r\\nout the memory that was tormenting him.\\r\\nYour worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous \\r\\nsystem. At any moment the tension inside you was liable to \\r\\ntranslate itself into some visible symptom. He thought of \\r\\na man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back; \\r\\na quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thir-\\n82 1984\\r\\nty-five to forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. They \\r\\nwere a few metres apart when the left side of the man’s face \\r\\nwas suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. It happened \\r\\nagain just as they were passing one another: it was only a \\r\\ntwitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, \\r\\nbut obviously habitual. He remembered thinking at the \\r\\ntime: That poor devil is done for. And what was frighten\\x02ing was that the action was quite possibly unconscious. The \\r\\nmost deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. There \\r\\nwas no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.\\r\\nHe drew his breath and went on writing:\\r\\nI went with her through the doorway and across a backyard \\r\\ninto a basement kitchen. There was a bed against the wall, \\r\\nand a lamp on the table, turned down very low. She——\\r\\nHis teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit. \\r\\nSimultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen \\r\\nhe thought of Katharine, his wife. Winston was married—\\r\\nhad been married, at any rate: probably he still was married, \\r\\nso far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to \\r\\nbreathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitch\\x02en, an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and \\r\\nvillainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because \\r\\nno woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be imag\\x02ined as doing so. Only the proles used scent. In his mind the \\r\\nsmell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication.\\r\\nWhen he had gone with that woman it had been his first \\r\\nlapse in two years or thereabouts. Consorting with prosti-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 83\\r\\ntutes was forbidden, of course, but it was one of those rules \\r\\nthat you could occasionally nerve yourself to break. It was \\r\\ndangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be \\r\\ncaught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced\\x02labour camp: not more, if you had committed no other \\r\\noffence. And it was easy enough, provided that you could \\r\\navoid being caught in the act. The poorer quarters swarmed \\r\\nwith women who were ready to sell themselves. Some could \\r\\neven be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were \\r\\nnot supposed to drink. Tacitly the Party was even inclined \\r\\nto encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which \\r\\ncould not be altogether suppressed. Mere debauchery did \\r\\nnot matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless \\r\\nand only involved the women of a submerged and despised \\r\\nclass. The unforgivable crime was promiscuity between \\r\\nParty members. But—though this was one of the crimes \\r\\nthat the accused in the great purges invariably confessed \\r\\nto—it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually hap\\x02pening.\\r\\nThe aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and \\r\\nwomen from forming loyalties which it might not be able \\r\\nto control. Its real, undeclared purpose was to remove all \\r\\npleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much as eroti\\x02cism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. \\r\\nAll marriages between Party members had to be approved \\r\\nby a committee appointed for the purpose, and—though \\r\\nthe principle was never clearly stated—permission was al\\x02ways refused if the couple concerned gave the impression \\r\\nof being physically attracted to one another. The only rec-\\n84 1984\\r\\nognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the \\r\\nservice of the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on \\r\\nas a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an en\\x02ema. This again was never put into plain words, but in an \\r\\nindirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from \\r\\nchildhood onwards. There were even organizations such \\r\\nas the Junior Anti-Sex League, which advocated complete \\r\\ncelibacy for both sexes. All children were to be begotten \\r\\nby artificial insemination (ARTSEM, it was called in New\\x02speak) and brought up in public institutions. This, Winston \\r\\nwas aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but some\\x02how it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party. The \\r\\nParty was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could not be \\r\\nkilled, then to distort it and dirty it. He did not know why \\r\\nthis was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so. And \\r\\nas far as the women were concerned, the Party’s efforts were \\r\\nlargely successful.\\r\\nHe thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten—\\r\\nnearly eleven years since they had parted. It was curious \\r\\nhow seldom he thought of her. For days at a time he was ca\\x02pable of forgetting that he had ever been married. They had \\r\\nonly been together for about fifteen months. The Party did \\r\\nnot permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in \\r\\ncases where there were no children.\\r\\nKatharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with \\r\\nsplendid movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face \\r\\nthat one might have called noble until one discovered that \\r\\nthere was as nearly as possible nothing behind it. Very early \\r\\nin her married life he had decided—though perhaps it was \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 85\\r\\nonly that he knew her more intimately than he knew most \\r\\npeople—that she had without exception the most stupid, \\r\\nvulgar, empty mind that he had ever encountered. She had \\r\\nnot a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there \\r\\nwas no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable \\r\\nof swallowing if the Party handed it out to her. ‘The hu\\x02man sound-track’ he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet \\r\\nhe could have endured living with her if it had not been for \\r\\njust one thing—sex.\\r\\nAs soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiff\\x02en. To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden \\r\\nimage. And what was strange was that even when she was \\r\\nclasping him against her he had the feeling that she was si\\x02multaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The \\r\\nrigidlty of her muscles managed to convey that impres\\x02sion. She would lie there with shut eyes, neither resisting \\r\\nnor co-operating but SUBMITTING. It was extraordinari\\x02ly embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then \\r\\nhe could have borne living with her if it had been agreed \\r\\nthat they should remain celibate. But curiously enough it \\r\\nwas Katharine who refused this. They must, she said, pro\\x02duce a child if they could. So the performance continued to \\r\\nhappen, once a week quite regulariy, whenever it was not \\r\\nimpossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morn\\x02ing, as something which had to be done that evening and \\r\\nwhich must not be forgotten. She had two names for it. One \\r\\nwas ‘making a baby’, and the other was ‘our duty to the Par\\x02ty’ (yes, she had actually used that phrase). Quite soon he \\r\\ngrew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed \\n86 1984\\r\\nday came round. But luckily no child appeared, and in the \\r\\nend she agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards they \\r\\nparted.\\r\\nWinston sighed inaudibly. He picked up his pen again \\r\\nand wrote:\\r\\nShe threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any \\r\\nkind of preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can \\r\\nimagine, pulled up her skirt. I——\\r\\nHe saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, \\r\\nwith the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils, and \\r\\nin his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even \\r\\nat that moment was mixed up with the thought of Kath\\x02arine’s white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power \\r\\nof the Party. Why did it always have to be like this? Why \\r\\ncould he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy \\r\\nscuffles at intervals of years? But a real love affair was an al\\x02most unthinkable event. The women of the Party were all \\r\\nalike. Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as Party loy\\x02alty. By careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, \\r\\nby the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in \\r\\nthe Spies and the Youth League, by lectures, parades, songs, \\r\\nslogans, and martial music, the natural feeling had been \\r\\ndriven out of them. His reason told him that there must be \\r\\nexceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all im\\x02pregnable, as the Party intended that they should be. And \\r\\nwhat he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break \\r\\ndown that wall of virtue, even if it were only once in his \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 87\\r\\nwhole life. The sexual act, successfully performed, was re\\x02bellion. Desire was thoughtcrime. Even to have awakened \\r\\nKatharine, if he could have achieved it, would have been \\r\\nlike a seduction, although she was his wife.\\r\\nBut the rest of the story had got to be written down. He \\r\\nwrote:\\r\\nI turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light——\\r\\nAfter the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp \\r\\nhad seemed very bright. For the first time he could see the \\r\\nwoman properly. He had taken a step towards her and then \\r\\nhalted, full of lust and terror. He was painfully conscious of \\r\\nthe risk he had taken in coming here. It was perfectly pos\\x02sible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for \\r\\nthat matter they might be waiting outside the door at this \\r\\nmoment. If he went away without even doing what he had \\r\\ncome here to do——!\\r\\nIt had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed. \\r\\nWhat he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the \\r\\nwoman was OLD. The paint was plastered so thick on her \\r\\nface that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard \\r\\nmask. There were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly \\r\\ndreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open, \\r\\nrevealing nothing except a cavernous blackness. She had no \\r\\nteeth at all.\\r\\nHe wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:\\r\\nWhen I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty \\n88 1984\\r\\nyears old at least. But I went ahead and did it just the same.\\r\\nHe pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. He had \\r\\nwritten it down at last, but it made no difference. The thera\\x02py had not worked. The urge to shout filthy words at the top \\r\\nof his voice was as strong as ever.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 89\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\n‘\\r\\nIf there is hope,’ wrote Winston, ‘it lies in the proles.’\\r\\nIf there was hope, it MUST lie in the proles, because \\r\\nonly there in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 per \\r\\ncent of the population of Oceania, could the force to de\\x02stroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could not be \\r\\noverthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, \\r\\nhad no way of coming together or even of identifying one \\r\\nanother. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just \\r\\npossibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members \\r\\ncould ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. \\r\\nRebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, \\r\\nat the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, \\r\\nif only they could somehow become conscious of their own \\r\\nstrength. would have no need to conspire. They needed only \\r\\nto rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. \\r\\nIf they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow \\r\\nmorning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do \\r\\nit? And yet——!\\r\\nHe remembered how once he had been walking down \\r\\na crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of \\r\\nvoices women’s voices—had burst from a side-street a little \\r\\nway ahead. It was a great formidable cry of anger and de\\x02spair, a deep, loud ‘Oh-o-o-o-oh!’ that went humming on \\r\\nlike the reverberation of a bell. His heart had leapt. It’s start-\\n90 1984\\r\\ned! he had thought. A riot! The proles are breaking loose \\r\\nat last! When he had reached the spot it was to see a mob \\r\\nof two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls \\r\\nof a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had \\r\\nbeen the doomed passengers on a sinking ship. But at this \\r\\nmoment the general despair broke down into a multitude \\r\\nof individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the stalls \\r\\nhad been selling tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsy \\r\\nthings, but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult \\r\\nto get. Now the supply had unexpectedly given out. The \\r\\nsuccessful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were \\r\\ntrying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of \\r\\nothers clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper \\r\\nof favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere \\r\\nin reserve. There was a fresh outburst of yells. Two bloat\\x02ed women, one of them with her hair coming down, had \\r\\ngot hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it \\r\\nout of one another’s hands. For a moment they were both \\r\\ntugging, and then the handle came off. Winston watched \\r\\nthem disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what almost \\r\\nfrightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few \\r\\nhundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout \\r\\nlike that about anything that mattered?\\r\\nHe wrote:\\r\\nUntil they become conscious they will never rebel, and until \\r\\nafter they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.\\r\\nThat, he reflected, might almost have been a transcrip-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 91\\r\\ntion from one of the Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of \\r\\ncourse, to have liberated the proles from bondage. Before \\r\\nthe Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the \\r\\ncapitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had \\r\\nbeen forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work \\r\\nin the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had been \\r\\nsold into the factories at the age of six. But simultaneous\\x02ly, true to the Principles of doublethink, the Party taught \\r\\nthat the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in \\r\\nsubjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple \\r\\nrules. In reality very little was known about the proles. It \\r\\nwas not necessary to know much. So long as they contin\\x02ued to work and breed, their other activities were without \\r\\nimportance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned loose \\r\\nupon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of \\r\\nlife that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral \\r\\npattern. They were born, they grew up in the gutters, they \\r\\nwent to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blos\\x02soming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at \\r\\ntwenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the \\r\\nmost part, at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home \\r\\nand children, petty quarrels with neighbours, films, foot\\x02ball, beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizon \\r\\nof their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult. \\r\\nA few agents of the Thought Police moved always among \\r\\nthem, spreading false rumours and marking down and \\r\\neliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of \\r\\nbecoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctri\\x02nate them with the ideology of the Party. It was not desirable \\n92 1984\\r\\nthat the proles should have strong political feelings. All that \\r\\nwas required of them was a primitive patriotism which \\r\\ncould be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make \\r\\nthem accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And \\r\\neven when they became discontented, as they sometimes \\r\\ndid, their discontent led nowhere, because being without \\r\\ngeneral ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific \\r\\ngrievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice. \\r\\nThe great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in \\r\\ntheir homes. Even the civil police interfered with them very \\r\\nlittle. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a \\r\\nwhole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, \\r\\ndrug-peddlers, and racketeers of every description; but \\r\\nsince it all happened among the proles themselves, it was \\r\\nof no importance. In all questions of morals they were al\\x02lowed to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism \\r\\nof the Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity went \\r\\nunpunished, divorce was permitted. For that matter, even \\r\\nreligious worship would have been permitted if the proles \\r\\nhad shown any sign of needing or wanting it. They were \\r\\nbeneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: ‘Proles and \\r\\nanimals are free.’\\r\\nWinston reached down and cautiously scratched his \\r\\nvaricose ulcer. It had begun itching again. The thing you \\r\\ninvariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing \\r\\nwhat life before the Revolution had really been like. He took \\r\\nout of the drawer a copy of a children’s history textbook \\r\\nwhich he had borrowed from Mrs Parsons, and began copy\\x02ing a passage into the diary:\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 93\\r\\nIn the old days (it ran), before the glorious Revolution, \\r\\nLondon was not the beautiful city that we know today. It \\r\\nwas a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody \\r\\nhad enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of \\r\\npoor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to \\r\\nsleep under. Children no older than you had to work twelve \\r\\nhours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips \\r\\nif they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale \\r\\nbreadcrusts and water. But in among all this terrible poverty \\r\\nthere were just a few great big beautiful houses that were \\r\\nlived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to \\r\\nlook after them. These rich men were called capitalists. They \\r\\nwere fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the \\r\\npicture on the opposite page. You can see that he is dressed in \\r\\na long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, \\r\\nshiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat. \\r\\nThis was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was \\r\\nallowed to wear it. The capitalists owned everything in the \\r\\nworld, and everyone else was their slave. They owned all the \\r\\nland, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. If \\r\\nanyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison, or \\r\\nthey could take his job away and starve him to death. When \\r\\nany ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and \\r\\nbow to him, and take off his cap and address him as ‘Sir’. The \\r\\nchief of all the capitalists was called the King, and——\\r\\nBut he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would be \\r\\nmention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in \\r\\ntheir ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the \\n94 1984\\r\\ncat-o’-nine tails, the Lord Mayor’s Banquet, and the prac\\x02tice of kissing the Pope’s toe. There was also something \\r\\ncalled the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, which would probably \\r\\nnot be mentioned in a textbook for children. It was the law \\r\\nby which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any \\r\\nwoman working in one of his factories.\\r\\nHow could you tell how much of it was lies? It MIGHT \\r\\nbe true that the average human being was better off now \\r\\nthan he had been before the Revolution. The only evidence \\r\\nto the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the \\r\\ninstinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were in\\x02tolerable and that at some other time they must have been \\r\\ndifferent. It struck him that the truly characteristic thing \\r\\nabout modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but \\r\\nsimply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. Life, if you \\r\\nlooked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies \\r\\nthat streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals \\r\\nthat the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even \\r\\nfor a Party member, were neutral and non-political, a mat\\x02ter of slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on \\r\\nthe Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine \\r\\ntablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the Par\\x02ty was something huge, terrible, and glittering—a world of \\r\\nsteel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying \\r\\nweapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching for\\x02ward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and \\r\\nshouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, \\r\\ntriumphing, persecuting—three hundred million people all \\r\\nwith the same face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 95\\r\\nwhere underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes, \\r\\nin patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always \\r\\nof cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of \\r\\nLondon, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and \\r\\nmixed up with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman \\r\\nwith lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a \\r\\nblocked waste-pipe.\\r\\nHe reached down and scratched his ankle again. Day \\r\\nand night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics \\r\\nproving that people today had more food, more clothes, \\r\\nbetter houses, better recreations—that they lived longer, \\r\\nworked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, hap\\x02pier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of \\r\\nfifty years ago. Not a word of it could ever be proved or dis\\x02proved. The Party claimed, for example, that today 40 per \\r\\ncent of adult proles were literate: before the Revolution, it \\r\\nwas said, the number had only been 15 per cent. The Party \\r\\nclaimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per \\r\\nthousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been 300—\\r\\nand so it went on. It was like a single equation with two \\r\\nunknowns. It might very well be that literally every word in \\r\\nthe history books, even the things that one accepted with\\x02out question, was pure fantasy. For all he knew there might \\r\\nnever have been any such law as the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, \\r\\nor any such creature as a capitalist, or any such garment as \\r\\na top hat.\\r\\nEverything faded into mist. The past was erased, the era\\x02sure was forgotten, the lie became truth. Just once in his \\r\\nlife he had possessed—AFTER the event: that was what \\n96 1984\\r\\ncounted—concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of fal\\x02sification. He had held it between his fingers for as long as \\r\\nthirty seconds. In 1973, it must have been—at any rate, it \\r\\nwas at about the time when he and Katharine had parted. \\r\\nBut the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier.\\r\\nThe story really began in the middle sixties, the period of \\r\\nthe great purges in which the original leaders of the Revolu\\x02tion were wiped out once and for all. By 1970 none of them \\r\\nwas left, except Big Brother himself. All the rest had by that \\r\\ntime been exposed as traitors and counter-revolutionar\\x02ies. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where, \\r\\nand of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the \\r\\nmajority had been executed after spectacular public trials \\r\\nat which they made confession of their crimes. Among the \\r\\nlast survivors were three men named Jones, Aaronson, and \\r\\nRutherford. It must have been in 1965 that these three had \\r\\nbeen arrested. As often happened, they had vanished for a \\r\\nyear or more, so that one did not know whether they were \\r\\nalive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth \\r\\nto incriminate themselves in the usual way. They had con\\x02fessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the \\r\\nenemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the \\r\\nmurder of various trusted Party members, intrigues against \\r\\nthe leadership of Big Brother which had started long before \\r\\nthe Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing the \\r\\ndeath of hundreds of thousands of people. After confess\\x02ing to these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in \\r\\nthe Party, and given posts which were in fact sinecures but \\r\\nwhich sounded important. All three had written long, ab-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 97\\r\\nject articles in ‘The Times’, analysing the reasons for their \\r\\ndefection and promising to make amends.\\r\\nSome time after their release Winston had actually seen \\r\\nall three of them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He remembered \\r\\nthe sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched \\r\\nthem out of the corner of his eye. They were men far old\\x02er than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last \\r\\ngreat figures left over from the heroic days of the Party. The \\r\\nglamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still \\r\\nfaintly clung to them. He had the feeling, though already at \\r\\nthat time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he had \\r\\nknown their names years earlier than he had known that of \\r\\nBig Brother. But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouch\\x02ables, doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within \\r\\na year or two. No one who had once fallen into the hands \\r\\nof the Thought Police ever escaped in the end. They were \\r\\ncorpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.\\r\\nThere was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It \\r\\nwas not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such \\r\\npeople. They were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin \\r\\nflavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafe. \\r\\nOf the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance had most \\r\\nimpressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous \\r\\ncaricaturist, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame \\r\\npopular opinion before and during the Revolution. Even \\r\\nnow, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in The \\r\\nTimes. They were simply an imitation of his earlier manner, \\r\\nand curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were \\r\\na rehashing of the ancient themes—slum tenements, starv-\\n98 1984\\r\\ning children, street battles, capitalists in top hats—even on \\r\\nthe barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their \\r\\ntop hats an endless, hopeless effort to get back into the past. \\r\\nHe was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy grey hair, \\r\\nhis face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At \\r\\none time he must have been immensely strong; now his \\r\\ngreat body was sagging, sloping, bulging, falling away in \\r\\nevery direction. He seemed to be breaking up before one’s \\r\\neyes, like a mountain crumbling.\\r\\nIt was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not \\r\\nnow remember how he had come to be in the cafe at such \\r\\na time. The place was almost empty. A tinny music was \\r\\ntrickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in their \\r\\ncorner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded, \\r\\nthe waiter brought fresh glasses of gin. There was a chess\\x02board on the table beside them, with the pieces set out but \\r\\nno game started. And then, for perhaps half a minute in all, \\r\\nsomething happened to the telescreens. The tune that they \\r\\nwere playing changed, and the tone of the music changed \\r\\ntoo. There came into it—but it was something hard to de\\x02scribe. It was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note: in \\r\\nhis mind Winston called it a yellow note. And then a voice \\r\\nfrom the telescreen was singing:\\r\\nUnder the spreading chestnut tree \\r\\nI sold you and you sold me: \\r\\nThere lie they, and here lie we \\r\\nUnder the spreading chestnut tree.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 99\\r\\nThe three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced \\r\\nagain at Rutherford’s ruinous face, he saw that his eyes \\r\\nwere full of tears. And for the first time he noticed, with a \\r\\nkind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing AT WHAT \\r\\nhe shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had bro\\x02ken noses.\\r\\nA little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared that \\r\\nthey had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very mo\\x02ment of their release. At their second trial they confessed to \\r\\nall their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new \\r\\nones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded in \\r\\nthe Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years \\r\\nafter this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of docu\\x02ments which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on \\r\\nto his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which \\r\\nhad evidently been slipped in among the others and then \\r\\nforgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its sig\\x02nificance. It was a half-page torn out of ‘The Times’ of about \\r\\nten years earlier—the top half of the page, so that it included \\r\\nthe date—and it contained a photograph of the delegates at \\r\\nsome Party function in New York. Prominent in the middle \\r\\nof the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There \\r\\nwas no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the \\r\\ncaption at the bottom.\\r\\nThe point was that at both trials all three men had con\\x02fessed that on that date they had been on Eurasian soil. They \\r\\nhad flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous \\r\\nsomewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with members of \\r\\nthe Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed im-\\n100 1984\\r\\nportant military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston’s \\r\\nmemory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the \\r\\nwhole story must be on record in countless other places as \\r\\nwell. There was only one possible conclusion: the confes\\x02sions were lies.\\r\\nOf course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that \\r\\ntime Winston had not imagined that the people who were \\r\\nwiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes \\r\\nthat they were accused of. But this was concrete evidence; \\r\\nit was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone \\r\\nwhich turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geo\\x02logical theory. It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if \\r\\nin some way it could have been published to the world and \\r\\nits significance made known.\\r\\nHe had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what \\r\\nthe photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered it \\r\\nup with another sheet of paper. Luckily, when he unrolled \\r\\nit, it had been upside-down from the point of view of the \\r\\ntelescreen.\\r\\nHe took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back \\r\\nhis chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as pos\\x02sible. To keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and \\r\\neven your breathing could be controlled, with an effort: \\r\\nbut you could not control the beating of your heart, and \\r\\nthe telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He \\r\\nlet what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all \\r\\nthe while by the fear that some accident—a sudden draught \\r\\nblowing across his desk, for instance—would betray him. \\r\\nThen, without uncovering it again, he dropped the photo-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 101\\r\\ngraph into the memory hole, along with some other waste \\r\\npapers. Within another minute, perhaps, it would have \\r\\ncrumbled into ashes.\\r\\nThat was ten—eleven years ago. Today, probably, he \\r\\nwould have kept that photograph. It was curious that the \\r\\nfact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make \\r\\na difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well \\r\\nas the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party’s \\r\\nhold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece \\r\\nof evidence which existed no longer HAD ONCE existed?\\r\\nBut today, supposing that it could be somehow resur\\x02rected from its ashes, the photograph might not even be \\r\\nevidence. Already, at the time when he made his discov\\x02ery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must \\r\\nhave been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men \\r\\nhad betrayed their country. Since then there had been oth\\x02er changes—two, three, he could not remember how many. \\r\\nVery likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten \\r\\nuntil the original facts and dates no longer had the small\\x02est significance. The past not only changed, but changed \\r\\ncontinuously. What most afflicted him with the sense of \\r\\nnightmare was that he had never clearly understood why \\r\\nthe huge imposture was undertaken. The immediate advan\\x02tages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the ultimate \\r\\nmotive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and \\r\\nwrote:\\r\\nI understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.\\n102 1984\\r\\nHe wondered, as he had many times wondered before, \\r\\nwhether he himself was a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was \\r\\nsimply a minority of one. At one time it had been a sign of \\r\\nmadness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today, \\r\\nto believe that the past is inalterable. He might be ALONE \\r\\nin holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the \\r\\nthought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the \\r\\nhorror was that he might also be wrong.\\r\\nHe picked up the children’s history book and looked at \\r\\nthe portrait of Big Brother which formed its frontispiece. \\r\\nThe hypnotic eyes gazed into his own. It was as though \\r\\nsome huge force were pressing down upon you—something \\r\\nthat penetrated inside your skull, battering against your \\r\\nbrain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, \\r\\nalmost, to deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the \\r\\nParty would announce that two and two made five, and you \\r\\nwould have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should \\r\\nmake that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position \\r\\ndemanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the \\r\\nvery existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their \\r\\nphilosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense. And \\r\\nwhat was terrifying was not that they would kill you for \\r\\nthinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after \\r\\nall, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that \\r\\nthe force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchange\\x02able? If both the past and the external world exist only in \\r\\nthe mind, and if the mind itself is controllable what then?\\r\\nBut no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its \\r\\nown accord. The face of O’Brien, not called up by any obvi-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 103\\r\\nous association, had floated into his mind. He knew, with \\r\\nmore certainty than before, that O’Brien was on his side. \\r\\nHe was writing the diary for O’Brien—TO O’Brien: it was \\r\\nlike an interminable letter which no one would ever read, \\r\\nbut which was addressed to a particular person and took its \\r\\ncolour from that fact.\\r\\nThe Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and \\r\\nears. It was their final, most essential command. His heart \\r\\nsank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against \\r\\nhim, the ease with which any Party intellectual would over\\x02throw him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would \\r\\nnot be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he \\r\\nwas in the right! They were wrong and he was right. The \\r\\nobvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended. Tru\\x02isms are true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its laws \\r\\ndo not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsup\\x02ported fall towards the earth’s centre. With the feeling that \\r\\nhe was speaking to O’Brien, and also that he was setting \\r\\nforth an important axiom, he wrote:\\r\\nFreedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If \\r\\nthat is granted, all else follows.\\n104 1984\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\nFrom somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of \\r\\nroasting coffee—real coffee, not Victory Coffee—came \\r\\nfloating out into the street. Winston paused involuntarily. \\r\\nFor perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten \\r\\nworld of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cut \\r\\noff the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound.\\r\\nHe had walked several kilometres over pavements, and \\r\\nhis varicose ulcer was throbbing. This was the second time \\r\\nin three weeks that he had missed an evening at the Com\\x02munity Centre: a rash act, since you could be certain that \\r\\nthe number of your attendances at the Centre was care\\x02fully checked. In principle a Party member had no spare \\r\\ntime, and was never alone except in bed. It was assumed \\r\\nthat when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he would \\r\\nbe taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do \\r\\nanything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a \\r\\nwalk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. There was \\r\\na word for it in Newspeak: OWNLIFE, it was called, mean\\x02ing individualism and eccentricity. But this evening as he \\r\\ncame out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air had \\r\\ntempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it \\r\\nthat year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Cen\\x02tre, the boring, exhausting games, the lectures, the creaking \\r\\ncamaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable. On im-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 105\\r\\npulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered \\r\\noff into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, then \\r\\nnorth again, losing himself among unknown streets and \\r\\nhardly bothering in which direction he was going.\\r\\n‘If there is hope,’ he had written in the diary, ‘it lies in \\r\\nthe proles.’ The words kept coming back to him, statement \\r\\nof a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity. He was some\\x02where in the vague, brown-coloured slums to the north and \\r\\neast of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He was \\r\\nwalking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with \\r\\nbattered doorways which gave straight on the pavement \\r\\nand which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes. \\r\\nThere were puddles of filthy water here and there among the \\r\\ncobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and down narrow \\r\\nalley-ways that branched off on either side, people swarmed \\r\\nin astonishing numbers—girls in full bloom, with crude\\x02ly lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased the girls, and \\r\\nswollen waddling women who showed you what the girls \\r\\nwould be like in ten years’ time, and old bent creatures shuf\\x02fling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children \\r\\nwho played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells \\r\\nfrom their mothers. Perhaps a quarter of the windows in \\r\\nthe street were broken and boarded up. Most of the people \\r\\npaid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a sort of \\r\\nguarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-red \\r\\nforearms folded across thelr aprons were talking outside a \\r\\ndoorway. Winston caught scraps of conversation as he ap\\x02proached.\\r\\n‘’Yes,’ I says to ‘er, ‘that’s all very well,’ I says. ‘But if you’d \\n106 1984\\r\\nof been in my place you’d of done the same as what I done. \\r\\nIt’s easy to criticize,’ I says, ‘but you ain’t got the same prob\\x02lems as what I got.‘‘\\r\\n‘Ah,’ said the other, ‘that’s jest it. That’s jest where it is.’\\r\\nThe strident voices stopped abruptly. The women stud\\x02ied him in hostile silence as he went past. But it was not \\r\\nhostility, exactly; merely a kind of wariness, a momentary \\r\\nstiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal. The \\r\\nblue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in \\r\\na street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such \\r\\nplaces, unless you had definite business there. The patrols \\r\\nmight stop you if you happened to run into them. ‘May I see \\r\\nyour papers, comrade? What are you doing here? What time \\r\\ndid you leave work? Is this your usual way home?’—and so \\r\\non and so forth. Not that there was any rule against walking \\r\\nhome by an unusual route: but it was enough to draw atten\\x02tion to you if the Thought Police heard about it.\\r\\nSuddenly the whole street was in commotion. There \\r\\nwere yells of warning from all sides. People were shooting \\r\\ninto the doorways like rabbits. A young woman leapt out \\r\\nof a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a tiny \\r\\nchild playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and \\r\\nleapt back again, all in one movement. At the same instant a \\r\\nman in a concertina-like black suit, who had emerged from \\r\\na side alley, ran towards Winston, pointing excitedly to the \\r\\nsky.\\r\\n‘Steamer!’ he yelled. ‘Look out, guv’nor! Bang over’ead! \\r\\nLay down quick!’\\r\\n‘Steamer’ was a nickname which, for some reason, the \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 107\\r\\nproles applied to rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung \\r\\nhimself on his face. The proles were nearly always right \\r\\nwhen they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed \\r\\nto possess some kind of instinct which told them several \\r\\nseconds in advance when a rocket was coming, although \\r\\nthe rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound. Win\\x02ston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roar \\r\\nthat seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light \\r\\nobjects pattered on to his back. When he stood up he found \\r\\nthat he was covered with fragments of glass from the near\\x02est window.\\r\\nHe walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of \\r\\nhouses 200 metres up the street. A black plume of smoke \\r\\nhung in the sky, and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which \\r\\na crowd was already forming around the ruins. There was a \\r\\nlittle pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and \\r\\nin the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he \\r\\ngot up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the \\r\\nwrist. Apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so com\\x02pletely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.\\r\\nHe kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid \\r\\nthe crowd, turned down a side-street to the right. With\\x02in three or four minutes he was out of the area which the \\r\\nbomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of the \\r\\nstreets was going on as though nothing had happened. It \\r\\nwas nearly twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the \\r\\nproles frequented (’pubs’, they called them) were choked \\r\\nwith customers. From their grimy swing doors, endlessly \\r\\nopening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, \\n108 1984\\r\\nsawdust, and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting \\r\\nhouse-front three men were standing very close togeth\\x02er, the middle one of them holding a folded-up newspaper \\r\\nwhich the other two were studying over his shoulder. Even \\r\\nbefore he was near enough to make out the expression on \\r\\ntheir faces, Winston could see absorption in every line of \\r\\ntheir bodies. It was obviously some serious piece of news \\r\\nthat they were reading. He was a few paces away from them \\r\\nwhen suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were \\r\\nin violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on \\r\\nthe point of blows.\\r\\n‘Can’t you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you \\r\\nno number ending in seven ain’t won for over fourteen \\r\\nmonths!’\\r\\n‘Yes, it ‘as, then!’\\r\\n‘No, it ‘as not! Back ‘ome I got the ‘ole lot of ‘em for over \\r\\ntwo years wrote down on a piece of paper. I takes ‘em down \\r\\nreg’lar as the clock. An’ I tell you, no number ending in \\r\\nseven——’\\r\\n‘Yes, a seven ‘AS won! I could pretty near tell you the \\r\\nbleeding number. Four oh seven, it ended in. It were in Feb\\x02ruary—second week in February.’\\r\\n‘February your grandmother! I got it all down in black \\r\\nand white. An’ I tell you, no number——’\\r\\n‘Oh, pack it in!’ said the third man.\\r\\nThey were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked \\r\\nback when he had gone thirty metres. They were still ar\\x02guing, with vivid, passionate faces. The Lottery, with its \\r\\nweekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 109\\r\\nto which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable \\r\\nthat there were some millions of proles for whom the Lot\\x02tery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining \\r\\nalive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their \\r\\nintellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned, \\r\\neven people who could barely read and write seemed capa\\x02ble of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. \\r\\nThere was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by \\r\\nselling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. Winston had \\r\\nnothing to do with the running of the Lottery, which was \\r\\nmanaged by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (in\\x02deed everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were \\r\\nlargely imaginary. Only small sums were actually paid out, \\r\\nthe winners of the big prizes being non-existent persons. In \\r\\nthe absence of any real intercommunication between one \\r\\npart of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to ar\\x02range.\\r\\nBut if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling \\r\\non to that. When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: \\r\\nit was when you looked at the human beings passing you on \\r\\nthe pavement that it became an act of faith. The street into \\r\\nwhich he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling that he \\r\\nhad been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was \\r\\na main thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead \\r\\nthere came a din of shouting voices. The street took a sharp \\r\\nturn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into \\r\\na sunken alley where a few stall-keepers were selling tired\\x02looking vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered \\r\\nwhere he was. The alley led out into the main street, and \\n110 1984\\r\\ndown the next turning, not five minutes away, was the junk\\x02shop where he had bought the blank book which was now \\r\\nhis diary. And in a small stationer’s shop not far away he \\r\\nhad bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.\\r\\nHe paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the \\r\\nopposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose \\r\\nwindows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were \\r\\nmerely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but active, \\r\\nwith white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a \\r\\nprawn, pushed open the swing door and went in. As Win\\x02ston stood watching, it occurred to him that the old man, \\r\\nwho must be eighty at the least, had already been middle\\x02aged when the Revolution happened. He and a few others \\r\\nlike him were the last links that now existed with the van\\x02ished world of capitalism. In the Party itself there were not \\r\\nmany people left whose ideas had been formed before the \\r\\nRevolution. The older generation had mostly been wiped out \\r\\nin the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few who \\r\\nsurvived had long ago been terrified into complete intellec\\x02tual surrender. If there was any one still alive who could \\r\\ngive you a truthful account of conditions in the early part \\r\\nof the century, it could only be a prole. Suddenly the pas\\x02sage from the history book that he had copied into his diary \\r\\ncame back into Winston’s mind, and a lunatic impulse took \\r\\nhold of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape ac\\x02quaintance with that old man and question him. He would \\r\\nsay to him: ‘Tell me about your life when you were a boy. \\r\\nWhat was it like in those days? Were things better than they \\r\\nare now, or were they worse?’\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 111\\r\\nHurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, \\r\\nhe descended the steps and crossed the narrow street. It \\r\\nwas madness of course. As usual, there was no definite rule \\r\\nagainst talking to proles and frequenting their pubs, but it \\r\\nwas far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the pa\\x02trols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it \\r\\nwas not likely that they would believe him. He pushed open \\r\\nthe door, and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in \\r\\nthe face. As he entered the din of voices dropped to about \\r\\nhalf its volume. Behind his back he could feel everyone eye\\x02ing his blue overalls. A game of darts which was going on at \\r\\nthe other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as \\r\\nmuch as thirty seconds. The old man whom he had followed \\r\\nwas standing at the bar, having some kind of altercation \\r\\nwith the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young man \\r\\nwith enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing round \\r\\nwith glasses in their hands, were watching the scene.\\r\\n‘I arst you civil enough, didn’t I?’ said the old man, \\r\\nstraightening his shoulders pugnaciously. ‘You telling me \\r\\nyou ain’t got a pint mug in the ‘ole bleeding boozer?’\\r\\n‘And what in hell’s name IS a pint?’ said the barman, lean\\x02ing forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter.\\r\\n‘’Ark at ‘im! Calls ‘isself a barman and don’t know what \\r\\na pint is! Why, a pint’s the ‘alf of a quart, and there’s four \\r\\nquarts to the gallon. ‘Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.’\\r\\n‘Never heard of ‘em,’ said the barman shortly. ‘Litre and \\r\\nhalf litre—that’s all we serve. There’s the glasses on the shelf \\r\\nin front of you.’\\r\\n‘I likes a pint,’ persisted the old man. ‘You could ‘a drawed \\n112 1984\\r\\nme off a pint easy enough. We didn’t ‘ave these bleeding li\\x02tres when I was a young man.’\\r\\n‘When you were a young man we were all living in the \\r\\ntreetops,’ said the barman, with a glance at the other cus\\x02tomers.\\r\\nThere was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused \\r\\nby Winston’s entry seemed to disappear. The old man’s whit\\x02estubbled face had flushed pink. He turned away, muttering \\r\\nto himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught him \\r\\ngently by the arm.\\r\\n‘May I offer you a drink?’ he said.\\r\\n‘You’re a gent,’ said the other, straightening his shoul\\x02ders again. He appeared not to have noticed Winston’s blue \\r\\noveralls. ‘Pint!’ he added aggressively to the barman. ‘Pint \\r\\nof wallop.’\\r\\nThe barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer \\r\\ninto thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under \\r\\nthe counter. Beer was the only drink you could get in prole \\r\\npubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin, though in \\r\\npractice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of \\r\\ndarts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar \\r\\nhad begun talking about lottery tickets. Winston’s presence \\r\\nwas forgotten for a moment. There was a deal table under \\r\\nthe window where he and the old man could talk without \\r\\nfear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but at \\r\\nany rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had \\r\\nmade sure of as soon as he came in.\\r\\n‘’E could ‘a drawed me off a pint,’ grumbled the old man \\r\\nas he settled down behind a glass. ‘A ‘alf litre ain’t enough. It \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 113\\r\\ndon’t satisfy. And a ‘ole litre’s too much. It starts my bladder \\r\\nrunning. Let alone the price.’\\r\\n‘You must have seen great changes since you were a young \\r\\nman,’ said Winston tentatively.\\r\\nThe old man’s pale blue eyes moved from the darts board \\r\\nto the bar, and from the bar to the door of the Gents, as \\r\\nthough it were in the bar-room that he expected the chang\\x02es to have occurred.\\r\\n‘The beer was better,’ he said finally. ‘And cheaper! When \\r\\nI was a young man, mild beer—wallop we used to call it—\\r\\nwas fourpence a pint. That was before the war, of course.’\\r\\n‘Which war was that?’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘It’s all wars,’ said the old man vaguely. He took up his \\r\\nglass, and his shoulders straightened again. ‘’Ere’s wishing \\r\\nyou the very best of ‘ealth!’\\r\\nIn his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam’s apple made \\r\\na surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement, and the beer \\r\\nvanished. Winston went to the bar and came back with two \\r\\nmore half-litres. The old man appeared to have forgotten \\r\\nhis prejudice against drinking a full litre.\\r\\n‘You are very much older than I am,’ said Winston. ‘You \\r\\nmust have been a grown man before I was born. You can \\r\\nremember what it was like in the old days, before the Revo\\x02lution. People of my age don’t really know anything about \\r\\nthose times. We can only read about them in books, and \\r\\nwhat it says in the books may not be true. I should like your \\r\\nopinion on that. The history books say that life before the \\r\\nRevolution was completely different from what it is now. \\r\\nThere was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty \\n114 1984\\r\\nworse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, the \\r\\ngreat mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth \\r\\nto death. Half of them hadn’t even boots on their feet. They \\r\\nworked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they \\r\\nslept ten in a room. And at the same time there were a very \\r\\nfew people, only a few thousands—the capitalists, they were \\r\\ncalled—who were rich and powerful. They owned every\\x02thing that there was to own. They lived in great gorgeous \\r\\nhouses with thirty servants, they rode about in motor-cars \\r\\nand four-horse carriages, they drank champagne, they wore \\r\\ntop hats——’\\r\\nThe old man brightened suddenly.\\r\\n‘Top ‘ats!’ he said. ‘Funny you should mention ‘em. The \\r\\nsame thing come into my ‘ead only yesterday, I dono why. I \\r\\nwas jest thinking, I ain’t seen a top ‘at in years. Gorn right \\r\\nout, they ‘ave. The last time I wore one was at my sister-in\\x02law’s funeral. And that was—well, I couldn’t give you the \\r\\ndate, but it must’a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only \\r\\n‘ired for the occasion, you understand.’\\r\\n‘It isn’t very important about the top hats,’ said Winston \\r\\npatiently. ‘The point is, these capitalists—they and a few \\r\\nlawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them—were \\r\\nthe lords of the earth. Everything existed for their benefit. \\r\\nYou—the ordinary people, the workers—were their slaves. \\r\\nThey could do what they liked with you. They could ship \\r\\nyou off to Canada like cattle. They could sleep with your \\r\\ndaughters if they chose. They could order you to be flogged \\r\\nwith something called a cat-o’-nine tails. You had to take \\r\\nyour cap off when you passed them. Every capitalist went \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 115\\r\\nabout with a gang of lackeys who——’\\r\\nThe old man brightened again.\\r\\n‘Lackeys!’ he said. ‘Now there’s a word I ain’t ‘eard since \\r\\never so long. Lackeys! That reg’lar takes me back, that does. \\r\\nI recollect oh, donkey’s years ago—I used to sometimes go \\r\\nto ‘Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to ‘ear the blokes making \\r\\nspeeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews, Indi\\x02ans—all sorts there was. And there was one bloke—well, I \\r\\ncouldn’t give you ‘is name, but a real powerful speaker ‘e \\r\\nwas. ‘E didn’t ‘alf give it ‘em! ‘Lackeys!’ ‘e says, ‘lackeys of \\r\\nthe bourgeoisie! Flunkies of the ruling class!’ Parasites—\\r\\nthat was another of them. And ‘yenas—’e definitely called \\r\\n‘em ‘yenas. Of course ‘e was referring to the Labour Party, \\r\\nyou understand.’\\r\\nWinston had the feeling that they were talking at cross\\x02purposes.\\r\\n‘What I really wanted to know was this,’ he said. ‘Do you \\r\\nfeel that you have more freedom now than you had in those \\r\\ndays? Are you treated more like a human being? In the old \\r\\ndays, the rich people, the people at the top——’\\r\\n‘The ‘Ouse of Lords,’ put in the old man reminiscently.\\r\\n‘The House of Lords, if you like. What I am asking is, \\r\\nwere these people able to treat you as an inferior, simply \\r\\nbecause they were rich and you were poor? Is it a fact, for \\r\\ninstance, that you had to call them ‘Sir’ and take off your \\r\\ncap when you passed them?’\\r\\nThe old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off \\r\\nabout a quarter of his beer before answering.\\r\\n‘Yes,’ he said. ‘They liked you to touch your cap to ‘em. \\n116 1984\\r\\nIt showed respect, like. I didn’t agree with it, myself, but I \\r\\ndone it often enough. Had to, as you might say.’\\r\\n‘And was it usual—I’m only quoting what I’ve read in his\\x02tory books—was it usual for these people and their servants \\r\\nto push you off the pavement into the gutter?’\\r\\n‘One of ‘em pushed me once,’ said the old man. ‘I recol\\x02lect it as if it was yesterday. It was Boat Race night—terribly \\r\\nrowdy they used to get on Boat Race night—and I bumps \\r\\ninto a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue. Quite a gent, \\r\\n‘e was—dress shirt, top ‘at, black overcoat. ‘E was kind of \\r\\nzig-zagging across the pavement, and I bumps into ‘im acci\\x02dental-like. ‘E says, ‘Why can’t you look where you’re going?’ \\r\\n‘e says. I say, ‘Ju think you’ve bought the bleeding pavement?’ \\r\\n‘E says, ‘I’ll twist your bloody ‘ead off if you get fresh with \\r\\nme.’ I says, ‘You’re drunk. I’ll give you in charge in ‘alf a \\r\\nminute,’ I says. An’ if you’ll believe me, ‘e puts ‘is ‘and on my \\r\\nchest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the \\r\\nwheels of a bus. Well, I was young in them days, and I was \\r\\ngoing to ‘ave fetched ‘im one, only——’\\r\\nA sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old \\r\\nman’s memory was nothing but a rubbish-heap of details. \\r\\nOne could question him all day without getting any real \\r\\ninformation. The party histories might still be true, after a \\r\\nfashion: they might even be completely true. He made a last \\r\\nattempt.\\r\\n‘Perhaps I have not made myself clear,’ he said. ‘What I’m \\r\\ntrying to say is this. You have been alive a very long time; \\r\\nyou lived half your life before the Revolution. In 1925, for \\r\\ninstance, you were already grown up. Would you say from \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 117\\r\\nwhat you can remember, that life in 1925 was better than it \\r\\nis now, or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to \\r\\nlive then or now?’\\r\\nThe old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He \\r\\nfinished up his beer, more slowly than before. When he \\r\\nspoke it was with a tolerant philosophical air, as though the \\r\\nbeer had mellowed him.\\r\\n‘I know what you expect me to say,’ he said. ‘You expect \\r\\nme to say as I’d sooner be young again. Most people’d say \\r\\nthey’d sooner be young, if you arst’ ‘em. You got your ‘ealth \\r\\nand strength when you’re young. When you get to my time \\r\\nof life you ain’t never well. I suffer something wicked from \\r\\nmy feet, and my bladder’s jest terrible. Six and seven times \\r\\na night it ‘as me out of bed. On the other ‘and, there’s great \\r\\nadvantages in being a old man. You ain’t got the same wor\\x02ries. No truck with women, and that’s a great thing. I ain’t \\r\\n‘ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you’d credit it. Nor \\r\\nwanted to, what’s more.’\\r\\nWinston sat back against the window-sill. It was no use \\r\\ngoing on. He was about to buy some more beer when the old \\r\\nman suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stink\\x02ing urinal at the side of the room. The extra half-litre was \\r\\nalready working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two \\r\\ngazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet \\r\\ncarried him out into the street again. Within twenty years \\r\\nat the most, he reflected, the huge and simple question, \\r\\n‘Was life better before the Revolution than it is now?’ would \\r\\nhave ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effect \\r\\nit was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered sur-\\n118 1984\\r\\nvivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing \\r\\none age with another. They remembered a million useless \\r\\nthings, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicy\\x02cle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister’s face, the \\r\\nswirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but \\r\\nall the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision. \\r\\nThey were like the ant, which can see small objects but not \\r\\nlarge ones. And when memory failed and written records \\r\\nwere falsified—when that happened, the claim of the Party \\r\\nto have improved the conditions of human life had got to be \\r\\naccepted, because there did not exist, and never again could \\r\\nexist, any standard against which it could be tested.\\r\\nAt this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. \\r\\nHe halted and looked up. He was in a narrow street, with a \\r\\nfew dark little shops, interspersed among dwelling-houses. \\r\\nImmediately above his head there hung three discoloured \\r\\nmetal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. \\r\\nHe seemed to know the place. Of course! He was standing \\r\\noutside the junk-shop where he had bought the diary.\\r\\nA twinge of fear went through him. It had been a suf\\x02ficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning, and he \\r\\nhad sworn never to come near the place again. And yet the \\r\\ninstant that he allowed his thoughts to wander, his feet had \\r\\nbrought him back here of their own accord. It was precisely \\r\\nagainst suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to \\r\\nguard himself by opening the diary. At the same time he \\r\\nnoticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours the \\r\\nshop was still open. With the feeling that he would be less \\r\\nconspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement, \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 119\\r\\nhe stepped through the doorway. If questioned, he could \\r\\nplausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades.\\r\\nThe proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which \\r\\ngave off an unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of per\\x02haps sixty, frail and bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, \\r\\nand mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles. His hair was al\\x02most white, but his eyebrows were bushy and still black. His \\r\\nspectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact that he \\r\\nwas wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague \\r\\nair of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of \\r\\nliterary man, or perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as \\r\\nthough faded, and his accent less debased than that of the \\r\\nmajority of proles.\\r\\n‘I recognized you on the pavement,’ he said immediately. \\r\\n‘You’re the gentleman that bought the young lady’s keepsake \\r\\nalbum. That was a beautiful bit of paper, that was. Cream\\x02laid, it used to be called. There’s been no paper like that \\r\\nmade for—oh, I dare say fifty years.’ He peered at Winston \\r\\nover the top of his spectacles. ‘Is there anything special I \\r\\ncan do for you? Or did you just want to look round?’\\r\\n‘I was passing,’ said Winston vaguely. ‘I just looked in. I \\r\\ndon’t want anything in particular.’\\r\\n‘It’s just as well,’ said the other, ‘because I don’t suppose \\r\\nI could have satisfied you.’ He made an apologetic gesture \\r\\nwith his softpalmed hand. ‘You see how it is; an empty shop, \\r\\nyou might say. Between you and me, the antique trade’s just \\r\\nabout finished. No demand any longer, and no stock either. \\r\\nFurniture, china, glass it’s all been broken up by degrees. \\r\\nAnd of course the metal stuff’s mostly been melted down. I \\n120 1984\\r\\nhaven’t seen a brass candlestick in years.’\\r\\nThe tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably \\r\\nfull, but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest val\\x02ue. The floorspace was very restricted, because all round \\r\\nthe walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture-frames. \\r\\nIn the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out \\r\\nchisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches \\r\\nthat did not even pretend to be in going order, and other \\r\\nmiscellaneous rubbish. Only on a small table in the corner \\r\\nwas there a litter of odds and ends—lacquered snuffbox\\x02es, agate brooches, and the like—which looked as though \\r\\nthey might include something interesting. As Winston \\r\\nwandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round, \\r\\nsmooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight, and he \\r\\npicked it up.\\r\\nIt was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat \\r\\non the other, making almost a hemisphere. There was a \\r\\npeculiar softness, as of rainwater, in both the colour and \\r\\nthe texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified by the \\r\\ncurved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object \\r\\nthat recalled a rose or a sea anemone.\\r\\n‘What is it?’ said Winston, fascinated.\\r\\n‘That’s coral, that is,’ said the old man. ‘It must have come \\r\\nfrom the Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in \\r\\nthe glass. That wasn’t made less than a hundred years ago. \\r\\nMore, by the look of it.’\\r\\n‘It’s a beautiful thing,’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘It is a beautiful thing,’ said the other appreciatively. ‘But \\r\\nthere’s not many that’d say so nowadays.’ He coughed. ‘Now, \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 121\\r\\nif it so happened that you wanted to buy it, that’d cost you \\r\\nfour dollars. I can remember when a thing like that would \\r\\nhave fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was—well, I \\r\\ncan’t work it out, but it was a lot of money. But who cares \\r\\nabout genuine antiques nowadays—even the few that’s \\r\\nleft?’\\r\\nWinston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid \\r\\nthe coveted thing into his pocket. What appealed to him \\r\\nabout it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to \\r\\npossess of belonging to an age quite different from the pres\\x02ent one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass that \\r\\nhe had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because \\r\\nof its apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it \\r\\nmust once have been intended as a paperweight. It was very \\r\\nheavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much \\r\\nof a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising thing, \\r\\nfor a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old, \\r\\nand for that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely \\r\\nsuspect. The old man had grown noticeably more cheerful \\r\\nafter receiving the four dollars. Winston realized that he \\r\\nwould have accepted three or even two.\\r\\n‘There’s another room upstairs that you might care to \\r\\ntake a look at,’ he said. ‘There’s not much in it. Just a few \\r\\npieces. We’ll do with a light if we’re going upstairs.’\\r\\nHe lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way \\r\\nslowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, \\r\\ninto a room which did not give on the street but looked out \\r\\non a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney-pots. Winston \\r\\nnoticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the \\n122 1984\\r\\nroom were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of car\\x02pet on the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, \\r\\nslatternly arm-chair drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fash\\x02ioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away \\r\\non the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying \\r\\nnearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with \\r\\nthe mattress still on it.\\r\\n‘We lived here till my wife died,’ said the old man half \\r\\napologetically. ‘I’m selling the furniture off by little and \\r\\nlittle. Now that’s a beautiful mahogany bed, or at least it \\r\\nwould be if you could get the bugs out of it. But I dare say \\r\\nyou’d find it a little bit cumbersome.’\\r\\nHe was holdlng the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the \\r\\nwhole room, and in the warm dim light the place looked \\r\\ncuriously inviting. The thought flitted through Winston’s \\r\\nmind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room \\r\\nfor a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It was a \\r\\nwild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought \\r\\nof; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a \\r\\nsort of ancestral memory. It seemed to him that he knew \\r\\nexactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an arm\\x02chair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a \\r\\nkettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with nobody \\r\\nwatching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the \\r\\nsinging of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.\\r\\n‘There’s no telescreen!’ he could not help murmuring.\\r\\n‘Ah,’ said the old man, ‘I never had one of those things. \\r\\nToo expensive. And I never seemed to feel the need of it, \\r\\nsomehow. Now that’s a nice gateleg table in the corner there. \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 123\\r\\nThough of course you’d have to put new hinges on it if you \\r\\nwanted to use the flaps.’\\r\\nThere was a small bookcase in the other corner, and \\r\\nWinston had already gravitated towards it. It contained \\r\\nnothing but rubbish. The hunting-down and destruction of \\r\\nbooks had been done with the same thoroughness in the \\r\\nprole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that \\r\\nthere existed anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed \\r\\nearlier than 1960. The old man, still carrying the lamp, was \\r\\nstanding in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which \\r\\nhung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite the bed.\\r\\n‘Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all—\\r\\n—’ he began delicately.\\r\\nWinston came across to examine the picture. It was a \\r\\nsteel engraving of an oval building with rectangular win\\x02dows, and a small tower in front. There was a railing \\r\\nrunning round the building, and at the rear end there was \\r\\nwhat appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some \\r\\nmoments. It seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not re\\x02member the statue.\\r\\n‘The frame’s fixed to the wall,’ said the old man, ‘but I \\r\\ncould unscrew it for you, I dare say.’\\r\\n‘I know that building,’ said Winston finally. ‘It’s a ruin \\r\\nnow. It’s in the middle of the street outside the Palace of \\r\\nJustice.’\\r\\n‘That’s right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in—\\r\\noh, many years ago. It was a church at one time, St Clement \\r\\nDanes, its name was.’ He smiled apologetically, as though \\r\\nconscious of saying something slightly ridiculous, and add-\\n124 1984\\r\\ned: ‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s!’\\r\\n‘What’s that?’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘Oh—‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s.’ \\r\\nThat was a rhyme we had when I was a little boy. How it goes \\r\\non I don’t remember, but I do know it ended up, ‘Here comes \\r\\na candle to light you to bed, Here comes a chopper to chop \\r\\noff your head.’ It was a kind of a dance. They held out their \\r\\narms for you to pass under, and when they came to ‘Here \\r\\ncomes a chopper to chop off your head’ they brought their \\r\\narms down and caught you. It was just names of churches. \\r\\nAll the London churches were in it—all the principal ones, \\r\\nthat is.’\\r\\nWinston wondered vaguely to what century the church \\r\\nbelonged. It was always difficult to determine the age of a \\r\\nLondon building. Anything large and impressive, if it was \\r\\nreasonably new in appearance, was automatically claimed \\r\\nas having been built since the Revolution, while anything \\r\\nthat was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim \\r\\nperiod called the Middle Ages. The centuries of capitalism \\r\\nwere held to have produced nothing of any value. One could \\r\\nnot learn history from architecture any more than one \\r\\ncould learn it from books. Statues, inscriptions, memori\\x02al stones, the names of streets—anything that might throw \\r\\nlight upon the past had been systematically altered.\\r\\n‘I never knew it had been a church,’ he said.\\r\\n‘There’s a lot of them left, really,’ said the old man, ‘though \\r\\nthey’ve been put to other uses. Now, how did that rhyme go? \\r\\nAh! I’ve got it!\\r\\n‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s, You \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 125\\r\\nowe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin’s——‘\\r\\nthere, now, that’s as far as I can get. A farthing, that was \\r\\na small copper coin, looked something like a cent.’\\r\\n‘Where was St Martin’s?’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘St Martin’s? That’s still standing. It’s in Victory Square, \\r\\nalongside the picture gallery. A building with a kind of a tri\\x02angular porch and pillars in front, and a big flight of steps.’\\r\\nWinston knew the place well. It was a museum used \\r\\nfor propaganda displays of various kinds—scale models of \\r\\nrocket bombs and Floating Fortresses, waxwork tableaux il\\x02lustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.\\r\\n‘St Martin’s-in-the-Fields it used to be called,’ supple\\x02mented the old man, ‘though I don’t recollect any fields \\r\\nanywhere in those parts.’\\r\\nWinston did not buy the picture. It would have been an \\r\\neven more incongruous possession than the glass paper\\x02weight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were taken \\r\\nout of its frame. But he lingered for some minutes more, \\r\\ntalking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not \\r\\nWeeks—as one might have gathered from the inscription \\r\\nover the shop-front—but Charrington. Mr Charrington, it \\r\\nseemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabit\\x02ed this shop for thirty years. Throughout that time he had \\r\\nbeen intending to alter the name over the window, but had \\r\\nnever quite got to the point of doing it. All the while that \\r\\nthey were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept run\\x02ning through Winston’s head. Oranges and lemons say the \\r\\nbells of St Clement’s, You owe me three farthings, say the \\r\\nbells of St Martin’s! It was curious, but when you said it to \\n126 1984\\r\\nyourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the \\r\\nbells of a lost London that still existed somewhere or other, \\r\\ndisguised and forgotten. From one ghostly steeple after an\\x02other he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet so far as \\r\\nhe could remember he had never in real life heard church \\r\\nbells ringing.\\r\\nHe got away from Mr Charrington and went down the \\r\\nstairs alone, so as not to let the old man see him recon\\x02noitring the street before stepping out of the door. He had \\r\\nalready made up his mind that after a suitable interval—a \\r\\nmonth, say—he would take the risk of visiting the shop \\r\\nagain. It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an \\r\\nevening at the Centre. The serious piece of folly had been to \\r\\ncome back here in the first place, after buying the diary and \\r\\nwithout knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could \\r\\nbe trusted. However——!\\r\\nYes, he thought again, he would come back. He would \\r\\nbuy further scraps of beautiful rubbish. He would buy the \\r\\nengraving of St Clement Danes, take it out of its frame, and \\r\\ncarry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls. He \\r\\nwould drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington’s \\r\\nmemory. Even the lunatic project of renting the room up\\x02stairs flashed momentarily through his mind again. For \\r\\nperhaps five seconds exaltation made him careless, and he \\r\\nstepped out on to the pavement without so much as a pre\\x02liminary glance through the window. He had even started \\r\\nhumming to an improvised tune\\r\\nOranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s, You \\r\\nowe me three farthings, say the——\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 127\\r\\nSuddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bow\\x02els to water. A figure in blue overalls was coming down \\r\\nthe pavement, not ten metres away. It was the girl from the \\r\\nFiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light was \\r\\nfailing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She \\r\\nlooked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as \\r\\nthough she had not seen him.\\r\\nFor a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move. \\r\\nThen he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not \\r\\nnoticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong \\r\\ndirection. At any rate, one question was settled. There was \\r\\nno doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She \\r\\nmust have followed him here, because it was not credible \\r\\nthat by pure chance she should have happened to be walk\\x02ing on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet, \\r\\nkilometres distant from any quarter where Party members \\r\\nlived. It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was really \\r\\nan agent of the Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy \\r\\nactuated by officiousness, hardly mattered. It was enough \\r\\nthat she was watching him. Probably she had seen him go \\r\\ninto the pub as well.\\r\\nIt was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocket \\r\\nbanged against his thigh at each step, and he was half mind\\x02ed to take it out and throw it away. The worst thing was the \\r\\npain in his belly. For a couple of minutes he had the feeling \\r\\nthat he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon. But \\r\\nthere would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. \\r\\nThen the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.\\r\\nThe street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood \\n128 1984\\r\\nfor several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then \\r\\nturned round and began to retrace his steps. As he turned \\r\\nit occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three \\r\\nminutes ago and that by running he could probably catch \\r\\nup with her. He could keep on her track till they were in \\r\\nsome quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cob\\x02blestone. The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy \\r\\nenough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately, \\r\\nbecause even the thought of making any physical effort was \\r\\nunbearable. He could not run, he could not strike a blow. \\r\\nBesides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself. \\r\\nHe thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and \\r\\nstaying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial \\r\\nalibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadly \\r\\nlassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get \\r\\nhome quickly and then sit down and be quiet.\\r\\nIt was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the \\r\\nflat. The lights would be switched off at the main at twenty\\x02three thirty. He went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly \\r\\na teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to the table in the \\r\\nalcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. But \\r\\nhe did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy fe\\x02male voice was squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring at \\r\\nthe marbled cover of the book, trying without success to \\r\\nshut the voice out of his consciousness.\\r\\nIt was at night that they came for you, always at night. The \\r\\nproper thing was to kill yourself before they got you. Un\\x02doubtedly some people did so. Many of the disappearances \\r\\nwere actually suicides. But it needed desperate courage to \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 129\\r\\nkill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and \\r\\ncertain poison, were completely unprocurable. He thought \\r\\nwith a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness \\r\\nof pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which \\r\\nalways freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a \\r\\nspecial effort is needed. He might have silenced the dark\\x02haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely \\r\\nbecause of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power \\r\\nto act. It struck him that in moments of crisis one is nev\\x02er fighting against an external enemy, but always against \\r\\none’s own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache \\r\\nin his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And it \\r\\nis the same, he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or trag\\x02ic situations. On the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on \\r\\na sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are al\\x02ways forgotten, because the body swells up until it fills the \\r\\nuniverse, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or \\r\\nscreaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle \\r\\nagainst hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stom\\x02ach or an aching tooth.\\r\\nHe opened the diary. It was important to write some\\x02thing down. The woman on the telescreen had started a new \\r\\nsong. Her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged \\r\\nsplinters of glass. He tried to think of O’Brien, for whom, \\r\\nor to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began \\r\\nthinking of the things that would happen to him after the \\r\\nThought Police took him away. It would not matter if they \\r\\nkilled you at once. To be killed was what you expected. But \\r\\nbefore death (nobody spoke of such things, yet everybody \\n130 1984\\r\\nknew of them) there was the routine of confession that had \\r\\nto be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and scream\\x02ing for mercy, the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth, \\r\\nand bloody clots of hair.\\r\\nWhy did you have to endure it, since the end was al\\x02ways the same? Why was it not possible to cut a few days \\r\\nor weeks out of your life? Nobody ever escaped detection, \\r\\nand nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had suc\\x02cumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date \\r\\nyou would be dead. Why then did that horror, which altered \\r\\nnothing, have to lie embedded in future time?\\r\\nHe tried with a little more success than before to sum\\x02mon up the image of O’Brien. ‘We shall meet in the place \\r\\nwhere there is no darkness,’ O’Brien had said to him. He \\r\\nknew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place where \\r\\nthere is no darkness was the imagined future, which one \\r\\nwould never see, but which, by foreknowledge, one could \\r\\nmystically share in. But with the voice from the telescreen \\r\\nnagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought \\r\\nfurther. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco \\r\\npromptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was \\r\\ndifficult to spit out again. The face of Big Brother swam into \\r\\nhis mind, displacing that of O’Brien. Just as he had done a \\r\\nfew days earlier, he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked \\r\\nat it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm, protecting: but \\r\\nwhat kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache? \\r\\nLike a leaden knell the words came back at him:\\r\\nWAR IS PEACE \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 131\\r\\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY \\r\\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\\n132 1984\\r\\nPart Two\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 133\\r\\nChapter 1\\r\\nI\\r\\nt was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left \\r\\nthe cubicle to go to the lavatory.\\r\\nA solitary figure was coming towards him from the oth\\x02er end of the long, brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl with \\r\\ndark hair. Four days had gone past since the evening when \\r\\nhe had run into her outside the junk-shop. As she came \\r\\nnearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not notice\\x02able at a distance because it was of the same colour as her \\r\\noveralls. Probably she had crushed her hand while swing\\x02ing round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots \\r\\nof novels were ‘roughed in’. It was a common accident in the \\r\\nFiction Department.\\r\\nThey were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stum\\x02bled and fell almost flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was \\r\\nwrung out of her. She must have fallen right on the injured \\r\\narm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risen to her knees. \\r\\nHer face had turned a milky yellow colour against which \\r\\nher mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed \\r\\non his, with an appealing expression that looked more like \\r\\nfear than pain.\\r\\nA curious emotion stirred in Winston’s heart. In front of \\r\\nhim was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front of \\r\\nhim, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with \\r\\na broken bone. Already he had instinctively started forward \\n134 1984\\r\\nto help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on the \\r\\nbandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his \\r\\nown body.\\r\\n‘You’re hurt?’ he said.\\r\\n‘It’s nothing. My arm. It’ll be all right in a second.’\\r\\nShe spoke as though her heart were fluttering. She had \\r\\ncertainly turned very pale.\\r\\n‘You haven’t broken anything?’\\r\\n‘No, I’m all right. It hurt for a moment, that’s all.’\\r\\nShe held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up. \\r\\nShe had regained some of her colour, and appeared very \\r\\nmuch better.\\r\\n‘It’s nothing,’ she repeated shortly. ‘I only gave my wrist a \\r\\nbit of a bang. Thanks, comrade!’\\r\\nAnd with that she walked on in the direction in which \\r\\nshe had been going, as briskly as though it had really been \\r\\nnothing. The whole incident could not have taken as much \\r\\nas half a minute. Not to let one’s feelings appear in one’s \\r\\nface was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct, \\r\\nand in any case they had been standing straight in front of \\r\\na telescreen when the thing happened. Nevertheless it had \\r\\nbeen very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise, for \\r\\nin the two or three seconds while he was helping her up \\r\\nthe girl had slipped something into his hand. There was no \\r\\nquestion that she had done it intentionally. It was some\\x02thing small and flat. As he passed through the lavatory door \\r\\nhe transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his \\r\\nfingers. It was a scrap of paper folded into a square.\\r\\nWhile he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 135\\r\\nmore fingering, to get it unfolded. Obviously there must be \\r\\na message of some kind written on it. For a moment he was \\r\\ntempted to take it into one of the water-closets and read it \\r\\nat once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew. \\r\\nThere was no place where you could be more certain that \\r\\nthe telescreens were watched continuously.\\r\\nHe went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the frag\\x02ment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk, \\r\\nput on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towards \\r\\nhim. ‘Five minutes,’ he told himself, ‘five minutes at the \\r\\nvery least!’ His heart bumped in his breast with frightening \\r\\nloudness. Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on \\r\\nwas mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, \\r\\nnot needing close attention.\\r\\nWhatever was written on the paper, it must have some \\r\\nkind of political meaning. So far as he could see there were \\r\\ntwo possibilities. One, much the more likely, was that the \\r\\ngirl was an agent of the Thought Police, just as he had feared. \\r\\nHe did not know why the Thought Police should choose to \\r\\ndeliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they \\r\\nhad their reasons. The thing that was written on the paper \\r\\nmight be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide, \\r\\na trap of some description. But there was another, wilder \\r\\npossibility that kept raising its head, though he tried vain\\x02ly to suppress it. This was, that the message did not come \\r\\nfrom the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of un\\x02derground organization. Perhaps the Brotherhood existed \\r\\nafter all! Perhaps the girl was part of it! No doubt the idea \\r\\nwas absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very in-\\n136 1984\\r\\nstant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not till \\r\\na couple of minutes later that the other, more probable ex\\x02planation had occurred to him. And even now, though his \\r\\nintellect told him that the message probably meant death—\\r\\nstill, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable \\r\\nhope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with diffi\\x02culty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured \\r\\nhis figures into the speakwrite.\\r\\nHe rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it \\r\\ninto the pneumatic tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re\\x02adjusted his spectacles on his nose, sighed, and drew the \\r\\nnext batch of work towards him, with the scrap of paper on \\r\\ntop of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a large un\\x02formed handwriting:\\r\\nI LOVE YOU.\\r\\nFor several seconds he was too stunned even to throw \\r\\nthe incriminating thing into the memory hole. When he \\r\\ndid so, although he knew very well the danger of showing \\r\\ntoo much interest, he could not resist reading it once again, \\r\\njust to make sure that the words were really there.\\r\\nFor the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. \\r\\nWhat was even worse than having to focus his mind on a \\r\\nseries of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation \\r\\nfrom the telescreen. He felt as though a fire were burning \\r\\nin his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteen \\r\\nwas torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little while \\r\\nduring the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 137\\r\\nimbecile Parsons flopped down beside him, the tang of his \\r\\nsweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up \\r\\na stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week. He \\r\\nwas particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of \\r\\nBig Brother’s head, two metres wide, which was being made \\r\\nfor the occasion by his daughter’s troop of Spies. The irri\\x02tating thing was that in the racket of voices Winston could \\r\\nhardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was constantly \\r\\nhaving to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just \\r\\nonce he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two oth\\x02er girls at the far end of the room. She appeared not to have \\r\\nseen him, and he did not look in that direction again.\\r\\nThe afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after lunch \\r\\nthere arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work which would \\r\\ntake several hours and necessitated putting everything else \\r\\naside. It consisted in falsifying a series of production re\\x02ports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on a \\r\\nprominent member of the Inner Party, who was now under \\r\\na cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good \\r\\nat, and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting \\r\\nthe girl out of his mind altogether. Then the memory of her \\r\\nface came back, and with it a raging, intolerable desire to \\r\\nbe alone. Until he could be alone it was impossible to think \\r\\nthis new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at \\r\\nthe Community Centre. He wolfed another tasteless meal \\r\\nin the canteen, hurried off to the Centre, took part in the \\r\\nsolemn foolery of a ‘discussion group’, played two games \\r\\nof table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and sat for \\r\\nhalf an hour through a lecture entitled ‘Ingsoc in relation to \\n138 1984\\r\\nchess’. His soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had \\r\\nhad no impulse to shirk his evening at the Centre. At the \\r\\nsight of the words I LOVE YOU the desire to stay alive had \\r\\nwelled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly \\r\\nseemed stupid. It was not till twenty-three hours, when he \\r\\nwas home and in bed—in the darkness, where you were safe \\r\\neven from the telescreen so long as you kept silent—that he \\r\\nwas able to think continuously.\\r\\nIt was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to \\r\\nget in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting. He did \\r\\nnot consider any longer the possibility that she might be \\r\\nlaying some kind of trap for him. He knew that it was not \\r\\nso, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed \\r\\nhim the note. Obviously she had been frightened out of her \\r\\nwits, as well she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her \\r\\nadvances even cross his mind. Only five nights ago he had \\r\\ncontemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone, but \\r\\nthat was of no importance. He thought of her naked, youth\\x02ful body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined \\r\\nher a fool like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies \\r\\nand hatred, her belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at \\r\\nthe thought that he might lose her, the white youthful body \\r\\nmight slip away from him! What he feared more than any\\x02thing else was that she would simply change her mind if he \\r\\ndid not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical dif\\x02ficulty of meeting was enormous. It was like trying to make \\r\\na move at chess when you were already mated. Whichever \\r\\nway you turned, the telescreen faced you. Actually, all the \\r\\npossible ways of communicating with her had occurred to \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 139\\r\\nhim within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with \\r\\ntime to think, he went over them one by one, as though lay\\x02ing out a row of instruments on a table.\\r\\nObviously the kind of encounter that had happened this \\r\\nmorning could not be repeated. If she had worked in the Re\\x02cords Department it might have been comparatively simple, \\r\\nbut he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building \\r\\nthe Fiction Department lay, and he had no pretext for going \\r\\nthere. If he had known where she lived, and at what time \\r\\nshe left work, he could have contrived to meet her some\\x02where on her way home; but to try to follow her home was \\r\\nnot safe, because it would mean loitering about outside the \\r\\nMinistry, which was bound to be noticed. As for sending \\r\\na letter through the mails, it was out of the question. By \\r\\na routine that was not even secret, all letters were opened \\r\\nin transit. Actually, few people ever wrote letters. For the \\r\\nmessages that it was occasionally necessary to send, there \\r\\nwere printed postcards with long lists of phrases, and you \\r\\nstruck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he \\r\\ndid not know the girl’s name, let alone her address. Final\\x02ly he decided that the safest place was the canteen. If he \\r\\ncould get her at a table by herself, somewhere in the middle \\r\\nof the room, not too near the telescreens, and with a suf\\x02ficient buzz of conversation all round—if these conditions \\r\\nendured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to ex\\x02change a few words.\\r\\nFor a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On \\r\\nthe next day she did not appear in the canteen until he \\r\\nwas leaving it, the whistle having already blown. Presum-\\n140 1984\\r\\nably she had been changed on to a later shift. They passed \\r\\neach other without a glance. On the day after that she was \\r\\nin the canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls \\r\\nand immediately under a telescreen. Then for three dread\\x02ful days she did not appear at all. His whole mind and body \\r\\nseemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort \\r\\nof transparency, which made every movement, every sound, \\r\\nevery contact, every word that he had to speak or listen \\r\\nto, an agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape \\r\\nfrom her image. He did not touch the diary during those \\r\\ndays. If there was any relief, it was in his work, in which he \\r\\ncould sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch. \\r\\nHe had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. \\r\\nThere was no enquiry he could make. She might have been \\r\\nvaporized, she might have committed suicide, she might \\r\\nhave been transferred to the other end of Oceania: worst \\r\\nand likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mind \\r\\nand decided to avoid him.\\r\\nThe next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling \\r\\nand she had a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist. The \\r\\nrelief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist star\\x02ing directly at her for several seconds. On the following day \\r\\nhe very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When he came \\r\\ninto the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the \\r\\nwall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was \\r\\nnot very full. The queue edged forward till Winston was \\r\\nalmost at the counter, then was held up for two minutes \\r\\nbecause someone in front was complaining that he had not \\r\\nreceived his tablet of saccharine. But the girl was still alone \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 141\\r\\nwhen Winston secured his tray and began to make for her \\r\\ntable. He walked casually towards her, his eyes searching \\r\\nfor a place at some table beyond her. She was perhaps three \\r\\nmetres away from him. Another two seconds would do it. \\r\\nThen a voice behind him called, ‘Smith!’ He pretended not \\r\\nto hear. ‘Smith!’ repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no \\r\\nuse. He turned round. A blond-headed, silly-faced young \\r\\nman named Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting \\r\\nhim with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not \\r\\nsafe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not \\r\\ngo and sit at a table with an unattended girl. It was too no\\x02ticeable. He sat down with a friendly smile. The silly blond \\r\\nface beamed into his. Winston had a hallucination of him\\x02self smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it. The \\r\\ngirl’s table filled up a few minutes later.\\r\\nBut she must have seen him coming towards her, and \\r\\nperhaps she would take the hint. Next day he took care to \\r\\narrive early. Surely enough, she was at a table in about the \\r\\nsame place, and again alone. The person immediately ahead \\r\\nof him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like \\r\\nman with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston \\r\\nturned away from the counter with his tray, he saw that the \\r\\nlittle man was making straight for the girl’s table. His hopes \\r\\nsank again. There was a vacant place at a table further away, \\r\\nbut something in the little man’s appearance suggested \\r\\nthat he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort \\r\\nto choose the emptiest table. With ice at his heart Winston \\r\\nfollowed. It was no use unless he could get the girl alone. \\r\\nAt this moment there was a tremendous crash. The little \\n142 1984\\r\\nman was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying, \\r\\ntwo streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. \\r\\nHe started to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, \\r\\nwhom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up. But \\r\\nit was all right. Five seconds later, with a thundering heart, \\r\\nWinston was sitting at the girl’s table.\\r\\nHe did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and prompt\\x02ly began eating. It was all-important to speak at once, \\r\\nbefore anyone else came, but now a terrible fear had taken \\r\\npossession of him. A week had gone by since she had first \\r\\napproached him. She would have changed her mind, she \\r\\nmust have changed her mind! It was impossible that this af\\x02fair should end successfully; such things did not happen in \\r\\nreal life. He might have flinched altogether from speaking if \\r\\nat this moment he had not seen Ampleforth, the hairy-eared \\r\\npoet, wandering limply round the room with a tray, look\\x02ing for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforth \\r\\nwas attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at \\r\\nhis table if he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a min\\x02ute in which to act. Both Winston and the girl were eating \\r\\nsteadily. The stuff they were eating was a thin stew, actually \\r\\na soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston began \\r\\nspeaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned \\r\\nthe watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls \\r\\nexchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless \\r\\nvoices.\\r\\n‘What time do you leave work?’\\r\\n‘Eighteen-thirty.’\\r\\n‘Where can we meet?’\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 143\\r\\n‘Victory Square, near the monument.’\\r\\n‘It’s full of telescreens.’\\r\\n‘It doesn’t matter if there’s a crowd.’\\r\\n‘Any signal?’\\r\\n‘No. Don’t come up to me until you see me among a lot \\r\\nof people. And don’t look at me. Just keep somewhere near \\r\\nme.’\\r\\n‘What time?’\\r\\n‘Nineteen hours.’\\r\\n‘All right.’\\r\\nAmpleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at an\\x02other table. They did not speak again, and, so far as it was \\r\\npossible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same \\r\\ntable, they did not look at one another. The girl finished her \\r\\nlunch quickly and made off, while Winston stayed to smoke \\r\\na cigarette.\\r\\nWinston was in Victory Square before the appointed \\r\\ntime. He wandered round the base of the enormous flut\\x02ed column, at the top of which Big Brother’s statue gazed \\r\\nsouthward towards the skies where he had vanquished the \\r\\nEurasian aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, \\r\\na few years ago) in the Battle of Airstrip One. In the street \\r\\nin front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which \\r\\nwas supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell. At five minutes \\r\\npast the hour the girl had still not appeared. Again the ter\\x02rible fear seized upon Winston. She was not coming, she \\r\\nhad changed her mind! He walked slowly up to the north \\r\\nside of the square and got a sort of pale-coloured pleasure \\r\\nfrom identifying St Martin’s Church, whose bells, when it \\n144 1984\\r\\nhad bells, had chimed ‘You owe me three farthings.’ Then \\r\\nhe saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, read\\x02ing or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the \\r\\ncolumn. It was not safe to go near her until some more peo\\x02ple had accumulated. There were telescreens all round the \\r\\npediment. But at this moment there was a din of shouting \\r\\nand a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. \\r\\nSuddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square. \\r\\nThe girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the \\r\\nmonument and joined in the rush. Winston followed. As he \\r\\nran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy \\r\\nof Eurasian prisoners was passing.\\r\\nAlready a dense mass of people was blocking the south \\r\\nside of the square. Winston, at normal times the kind of \\r\\nperson who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of \\r\\nscrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward into \\r\\nthe heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm’s length of \\r\\nthe girl, but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and \\r\\nan almost equally enormous woman, presumably his wife, \\r\\nwho seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh. Winston \\r\\nwriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge man\\x02aged to drive his shoulder between them. For a moment it \\r\\nfelt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp be\\x02tween the two muscular hips, then he had broken through, \\r\\nsweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were shoulder \\r\\nto shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.\\r\\nA long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed \\r\\nwith sub-machine guns standing upright in each corner, was \\r\\npassing slowly down the street. In the trucks little yellow \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 145\\r\\nmen in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting, jammed \\r\\nclose together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out over \\r\\nthe sides of the trucks utterly incurious. Occasionally when \\r\\na truck jolted there was a clank-clank of metal: all the pris\\x02oners were wearing leg-irons. Truck-load after truck-load of \\r\\nthe sad faces passed. Winston knew they were there but he \\r\\nsaw them only intermittently. The girl’s shoulder, and her \\r\\narm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Her \\r\\ncheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. \\r\\nShe had immediately taken charge of the situation, just as \\r\\nshe had done in the canteen. She began speaking in the \\r\\nsame expressionless voice as before, with lips barely mov\\x02ing, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and \\r\\nthe rumbling of the trucks.\\r\\n‘Can you hear me?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘Can you get Sunday afternoon off?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘Then listen carefully. You’ll have to remember this. Go \\r\\nto Paddington Station——’\\r\\nWith a sort of military precision that astonished him, she \\r\\noutlined the route that he was to follow. A half-hour railway \\r\\njourney; turn left outside the station; two kilometres along \\r\\nthe road; a gate with the top bar missing; a path across a \\r\\nfield; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes; a dead \\r\\ntree with moss on it. It was as though she had a map inside \\r\\nher head. ‘Can you remember all that?’ she murmured fi\\x02nally.\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\n146 1984\\r\\n‘You turn left, then right, then left again. And the gate’s \\r\\ngot no top bar.’\\r\\n‘Yes. What time?’\\r\\n‘About fifteen. You may have to wait. I’ll get there by an\\x02other way. Are you sure you remember everything?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘Then get away from me as quick as you can.’\\r\\nShe need not have told him that. But for the moment \\r\\nthey could not extricate themselves from the crowd. The \\r\\ntrucks were still filing past, the people still insatiably gap\\x02ing. At the start there had been a few boos and hisses, but \\r\\nit came only from the Party members among the crowd, \\r\\nand had soon stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply \\r\\ncuriosity. Foreigners, whether from Eurasia or from Easta\\x02sia, were a kind of strange animal. One literally never saw \\r\\nthem except in the guise of prisoners, and even as prison\\x02ers one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them. \\r\\nNor did one know what became of them, apart from the \\r\\nfew who were hanged as war-criminals: the others simply \\r\\nvanished, presumably into forced-labour camps. The round \\r\\nMogol faces had given way to faces of a more European type, \\r\\ndirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheek\\x02bones eyes looked into Winston’s, sometimes with strange \\r\\nintensity, and flashed away again. The convoy was drawing \\r\\nto an end. In the last truck he could see an aged man, his \\r\\nface a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wrists \\r\\ncrossed in front of him, as though he were used to having \\r\\nthem bound together. It was almost time for Winston and \\r\\nthe girl to part. But at the last moment, while the crowd still \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 147\\r\\nhemmed them in, her hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting \\r\\nsqueeze.\\r\\nIt could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a \\r\\nlong time that their hands were clasped together. He had \\r\\ntime to learn every detail of her hand. He explored the long \\r\\nfingers, the shapely nails, the work-hardened palm with its \\r\\nrow of callouses, the smooth flesh under the wrist. Merely \\r\\nfrom feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the same \\r\\ninstant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour \\r\\nthe girl’s eyes were. They were probably brown, but people \\r\\nwith dark hair sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head \\r\\nand look at her would have been inconceivable folly. With \\r\\nhands locked together, invisible among the press of bodies, \\r\\nthey stared steadily in front of them, and instead of the eyes \\r\\nof the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully \\r\\nat Winston out of nests of hair.\\n148 1984\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\nWinston picked his way up the lane through dappled \\r\\nlight and shade, stepping out into pools of gold wher\\x02ever the boughs parted. Under the trees to the left of him \\r\\nthe ground was misty with bluebells. The air seemed to kiss \\r\\none’s skin. It was the second of May. From somewhere deep\\x02er in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring doves.\\r\\nHe was a bit early. There had been no difficulties about \\r\\nthe journey, and the girl was so evidently experienced that \\r\\nhe was less frightened than he would normally have been. \\r\\nPresumably she could be trusted to find a safe place. In \\r\\ngeneral you could not assume that you were much safer in \\r\\nthe country than in London. There were no telescreens, of \\r\\ncourse, but there was always the danger of concealed mi\\x02crophones by which your voice might be picked up and \\r\\nrecognized; besides, it was not easy to make a journey by \\r\\nyourself without attracting attention. For distances of less \\r\\nthan 100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your pass\\x02port endorsed, but sometimes there were patrols hanging \\r\\nabout the railway stations, who examined the papers of any \\r\\nParty member they found there and asked awkward ques\\x02tions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk \\r\\nfrom the station he had made sure by cautious backward \\r\\nglances that he was not being followed. The train was full \\r\\nof proles, in holiday mood because of the summery weather. \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 149\\r\\nThe wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was filled \\r\\nto overflowing by a single enormous family, ranging from \\r\\na toothless great-grandmother to a month-old baby, going \\r\\nout to spend an afternoon with ‘in-laws’ in the country, and, \\r\\nas they freely explained to Winston, to get hold of a little \\r\\nblackmarket butter.\\r\\nThe lane widened, and in a minute he came to the foot\\x02path she had told him of, a mere cattle-track which plunged \\r\\nbetween the bushes. He had no watch, but it could not be \\r\\nfifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was \\r\\nimpossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and began \\r\\npicking some partly to pass the time away, but also from \\r\\na vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowers \\r\\nto offer to the girl when they met. He had got together a \\r\\nbig bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a \\r\\nsound at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of a \\r\\nfoot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was the best \\r\\nthing to do. It might be the girl, or he might have been fol\\x02lowed after all. To look round was to show guilt. He picked \\r\\nanother and another. A hand fell lightly on his shoulder.\\r\\nHe looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evi\\x02dently as a warning that he must keep silent, then parted \\r\\nthe bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow track \\r\\ninto the wood. Obviously she had been that way before, for \\r\\nshe dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston fol\\x02lowed, still clasping his bunch of flowers. His first feeling \\r\\nwas relief, but as he watched the strong slender body mov\\x02ing in front of him, with the scarlet sash that was just tight \\r\\nenough to bring out the curve of her hips, the sense of his \\n150 1984\\r\\nown inferiority was heavy upon him. Even now it seemed \\r\\nquite likely that when she turned round and looked at him \\r\\nshe would draw back after all. The sweetness of the air and \\r\\nthe greenness of the leaves daunted him. Already on the \\r\\nwalk from the station the May sunshine had made him feel \\r\\ndirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the sooty \\r\\ndust of London in the pores of his skin. It occurred to him \\r\\nthat till now she had probably never seen him in broad day\\x02light in the open. They came to the fallen tree that she had \\r\\nspoken of. The girl hopped over and forced apart the bush\\x02es, in which there did not seem to be an opening. When \\r\\nWinston followed her, he found that they were in a natural \\r\\nclearing, a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings that \\r\\nshut it in completely. The girl stopped and turned.\\r\\n‘Here we are,’ she said.\\r\\nHe was facing her at several paces’ distance. As yet he did \\r\\nnot dare move nearer to her.\\r\\n‘I didn’t want to say anything in the lane,’ she went on, \\r\\n‘in case there’s a mike hidden there. I don’t suppose there is, \\r\\nbut there could be. There’s always the chance of one of those \\r\\nswine recognizing your voice. We’re all right here.’\\r\\nHe still had not the courage to approach her. ‘We’re all \\r\\nright here?’ he repeated stupidly.\\r\\n‘Yes. Look at the trees.’ They were small ashes, which at \\r\\nsome time had been cut down and had sprouted up again \\r\\ninto a forest of poles, none of them thicker than one’s wrist. \\r\\n‘There’s nothing big enough to hide a mike in. Besides, I’ve \\r\\nbeen here before.’\\r\\nThey were only making conversation. He had managed \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 151\\r\\nto move closer to her now. She stood before him very up\\x02right, with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical, as \\r\\nthough she were wondering why he was so slow to act. The \\r\\nbluebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed to \\r\\nhave fallen of their own accord. He took her hand.\\r\\n‘Would you believe,’ he said, ‘that till this moment I \\r\\ndidn’t know what colour your eyes were?’ They were brown, \\r\\nhe noted, a rather light shade of brown, with dark lashes. \\r\\n‘Now that you’ve seen what I’m really like, can you still bear \\r\\nto look at me?’\\r\\n‘Yes, easily.’\\r\\n‘I’m thirty-nine years old. I’ve got a wife that I can’t get \\r\\nrid of. I’ve got varicose veins. I’ve got five false teeth.’\\r\\n‘I couldn’t care less,’ said the girl.\\r\\nThe next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was \\r\\nin his his arms. At the beginning he had no feeling except \\r\\nsheer incredulity. The youthful body was strained against \\r\\nhis own, the mass of dark hair was against his face, and yes! \\r\\nactually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the \\r\\nwide red mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck, \\r\\nshe was calling him darling, precious one, loved one. He \\r\\nhad pulled her down on to the ground, she was utterly un\\x02resisting, he could do what he liked with her. But the truth \\r\\nwas that he had no physical sensation, except that of mere \\r\\ncontact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He was glad \\r\\nthat this was happening, but he had no physical desire. It \\r\\nwas too soon, her youth and prettiness had frightened him, \\r\\nhe was too much used to living without women—he did \\r\\nnot know the reason. The girl picked herself up and pulled \\n152 1984\\r\\na bluebell out of her hair. She sat against him, putting her \\r\\narm round his waist.\\r\\n‘Never mind, dear. There’s no hurry. We’ve got the whole \\r\\nafternoon. Isn’t this a splendid hide-out? I found it when I \\r\\ngot lost once on a community hike. If anyone was coming \\r\\nyou could hear them a hundred metres away.’\\r\\n‘What is your name?’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘Julia. I know yours. It’s Winston—Winston Smith.’\\r\\n‘How did you find that out?’\\r\\n‘I expect I’m better at finding things out than you are, \\r\\ndear. Tell me, what did you think of me before that day I \\r\\ngave you the note?’\\r\\nHe did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. It was \\r\\neven a sort of love-offering to start off by telling the worst.\\r\\n‘I hated the sight of you,’ he said. ‘I wanted to rape you \\r\\nand then murder you afterwards. Two weeks ago I thought \\r\\nseriously of smashing your head in with a cobblestone. If \\r\\nyou really want to know, I imagined that you had some\\x02thing to do with the Thought Police.’\\r\\nThe girl laughed delightedly, evidently taking this as a \\r\\ntribute to the excellence of her disguise.\\r\\n‘Not the Thought Police! You didn’t honestly think that?’\\r\\n‘Well, perhaps not exactly that. But from your general \\r\\nappearance—merely because you’re young and fresh and \\r\\nhealthy, you understand—I thought that probably——’\\r\\n‘You thought I was a good Party member. Pure in word \\r\\nand deed. Banners, processions, slogans, games, commu\\x02nity hikes all that stuff. And you thought that if I had a \\r\\nquarter of a chance I’d denounce you as a thought-criminal \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 153\\r\\nand get you killed off?’\\r\\n‘Yes, something of that kind. A great many young girls \\r\\nare like that, you know.’\\r\\n‘It’s this bloody thing that does it,’ she said, ripping off \\r\\nthe scarlet sash of the Junior Anti-Sex League and flinging \\r\\nit on to a bough. Then, as though touching her waist had \\r\\nreminded her of something, she felt in the pocket of her \\r\\noveralls and produced a small slab of chocolate. She broke \\r\\nit in half and gave one of the pieces to Winston. Even be\\x02fore he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very \\r\\nunusual chocolate. It was dark and shiny, and was wrapped \\r\\nin silver paper. Chocolate normally was dull-brown crum\\x02bly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it, like \\r\\nthe smoke of a rubbish fire. But at some time or another he \\r\\nhad tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him. The \\r\\nfirst whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which \\r\\nhe could not pin down, but which was powerful and trou\\x02bling.\\r\\n‘Where did you get this stuff?’ he said.\\r\\n‘Black market,’ she said indifferently. ‘Actually I am that \\r\\nsort of girl, to look at. I’m good at games. I was a troop-lead\\x02er in the Spies. I do voluntary work three evenings a week \\r\\nfor the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours and hours I’ve spent \\r\\npasting their bloody rot all over London. I always carry one \\r\\nend of a banner in the processions. I always Iook cheer\\x02ful and I never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd, \\r\\nthat’s what I say. It’s the only way to be safe.’\\r\\nThe first fragment of chocolate had melted on Win\\x02ston’s tongue. The taste was delightful. But there was still \\n154 1984\\r\\nthat memory moving round the edges of his consciousness, \\r\\nsomething strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape, \\r\\nlike an object seen out of the corner of one’s eye. He pushed \\r\\nit away from him, aware only that it was the memory of \\r\\nsome action which he would have liked to undo but could \\r\\nnot.\\r\\n‘You are very young,’ he said. ‘You are ten or fifteen years \\r\\nyounger than I am. What could you see to attract you in a \\r\\nman like me?’\\r\\n‘It was something in your face. I thought I’d take a chance. \\r\\nI’m good at spotting people who don’t belong. As soon as I \\r\\nsaw you I knew you were against THEM.’\\r\\nTHEM, it appeared, meant the Party, and above all the \\r\\nInner Party, about whom she talked with an open jeering \\r\\nhatred which made Winston feel uneasy, although he knew \\r\\nthat they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere. A \\r\\nthing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of \\r\\nher language. Party members were supposed not to swear, \\r\\nand Winston himself very seldom did swear, aloud, at any \\r\\nrate. Julia, however, seemed unable to mention the Party, \\r\\nand especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of \\r\\nwords that you saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways. He \\r\\ndid not dislike it. It was merely one symptom of her revolt \\r\\nagainst the Party and all its ways, and somehow it seemed \\r\\nnatural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that smells \\r\\nbad hay. They had left the clearing and were wandering \\r\\nagain through the chequered shade, with their arms round \\r\\neach other’s waists whenever it was wide enough to walk \\r\\ntwo abreast. He noticed how much softer her waist seemed \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 155\\r\\nto feel now that the sash was gone. They did not speak above \\r\\na whisper. Outside the clearing, Julia said, it was better to \\r\\ngo quietly. Presently they had reached the edge of the little \\r\\nwood. She stopped him.\\r\\n‘Don’t go out into the open. There might be someone \\r\\nwatching. We’re all right if we keep behind the boughs.’\\r\\nThey were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. The \\r\\nsunlight, filtering through innumerable leaves, was still hot \\r\\non their faces. Winston looked out into the field beyond, \\r\\nand underwent a curious, slow shock of recognition. He \\r\\nknew it by sight. An old, closebitten pasture, with a foot\\x02path wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In \\r\\nthe ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm \\r\\ntrees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves \\r\\nstirred faintly in dense masses like women’s hair. Surely \\r\\nsomewhere nearby, but out of sight, there must be a stream \\r\\nwith green pools where dace were swimming?\\r\\n‘Isn’t there a stream somewhere near here?’ he whis\\x02pered.\\r\\n‘That’s right, there is a stream. It’s at the edge of the next \\r\\nfield, actually. There are fish in it, great big ones. You can \\r\\nwatch them lying in the pools under the willow trees, wav\\x02ing their tails.’\\r\\n‘It’s the Golden Country—almost,’ he murmured.\\r\\n‘The Golden Country?’\\r\\n‘It’s nothing, really. A landscape I’ve seen sometimes in \\r\\na dream.’\\r\\n‘Look!’ whispered Julia.\\r\\nA thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away, \\n156 1984\\r\\nalmost at the level of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen \\r\\nthem. It was in the sun, they in the shade. It spread out its \\r\\nwings, fitted them carefully into place again, ducked its \\r\\nhead for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to \\r\\nthe sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In \\r\\nthe afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Win\\x02ston and Julia clung together, fascinated. The music went on \\r\\nand on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations, \\r\\nnever once repeating itself, almost as though the bird were \\r\\ndeliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped \\r\\nfor a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then \\r\\nswelled its speckled breast and again burst into song. Win\\x02ston watched it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, for \\r\\nwhat, was that bird singing? No mate, no rival was watch\\x02ing it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and \\r\\npour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether af\\x02ter all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near. He \\r\\nand Julia had spoken only in low whispers, and it would not \\r\\npick up what they had said, but it would pick up the thrush. \\r\\nPerhaps at the other end of the instrument some small, bee\\x02tle-like man was listening intently—listening to that. But \\r\\nby degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of \\r\\nhis mind. It was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that \\r\\npoured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight \\r\\nthat filtered through the leaves. He stopped thinking and \\r\\nmerely felt. The girl’s waist in the bend of his arm was soft \\r\\nand warm. He pulled her round so that they were breast \\r\\nto breast; her body seemed to melt into his. Wherever his \\r\\nhands moved it was all as yielding as water. Their mouths \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 157\\r\\nclung together; it was quite different from the hard kisses \\r\\nthey had exchanged earlier. When they moved their faces \\r\\napart again both of them sighed deeply. The bird took fright \\r\\nand fled with a clatter of wings.\\r\\nWinston put his lips against her ear. ‘NOW,’ he whis\\x02pered.\\r\\n‘Not here,’ she whispered back. ‘Come back to the hide\\x02out. It’s safer.’\\r\\nQuickly, with an occasional crackle of twigs, they \\r\\nthreaded their way back to the clearing. When they were \\r\\nonce inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him. \\r\\nThey were both breathing fast, but the smile had reappeared \\r\\nround the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him \\r\\nfor an instant, then felt at the zipper of her overalls. And, \\r\\nyes! it was almost as in his dream. Almost as swiftly as he \\r\\nhad imagined it, she had torn her clothes off, and when she \\r\\nflung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture \\r\\nby which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. Her \\r\\nbody gleamed white in the sun. But for a moment he did \\r\\nnot look at her body; his eyes were anchored by the freckled \\r\\nface with its faint, bold smile. He knelt down before her and \\r\\ntook her hands in his.\\r\\n‘Have you done this before?’\\r\\n‘Of course. Hundreds of times—well, scores of times, \\r\\nanyway.’\\r\\n‘With Party members?’\\r\\n‘Yes, always with Party members.’\\r\\n‘With members of the Inner Party?’\\r\\n‘Not with those swine, no. But there’s plenty that WOULD \\n158 1984\\r\\nif they got half a chance. They’re not so holy as they make \\r\\nout.’\\r\\nHis heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he wished \\r\\nit had been hundreds—thousands. Anything that hinted at \\r\\ncorruption always filled him with a wild hope. Who knew, \\r\\nperhaps the Party was rotten under the surface, its cult of \\r\\nstrenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing in\\x02iquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them with \\r\\nleprosy or syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Any\\x02thing to rot, to weaken, to undermine! He pulled her down \\r\\nso that they were kneeling face to face.\\r\\n‘Listen. The more men you’ve had, the more I love you. \\r\\nDo you understand that?’\\r\\n‘Yes, perfectly.’\\r\\n‘I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don’t want any virtue \\r\\nto exist anywhere. I want everyone to be corrupt to the \\r\\nbones.’\\r\\n‘Well then, I ought to suit you, dear. I’m corrupt to the \\r\\nbones.’\\r\\n‘You like doing this? I don’t mean simply me: I mean the \\r\\nthing in itself?’\\r\\n‘I adore it.’\\r\\nThat was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely \\r\\nthe love of one person but the animal instinct, the simple \\r\\nundifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tear \\r\\nthe Party to pieces. He pressed her down upon the grass, \\r\\namong the fallen bluebells. This time there was no difficul\\x02ty. Presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed \\r\\nto normal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 159\\r\\nfell apart. The sun seemed to have grown hotter. They were \\r\\nboth sleepy. He reached out for the discarded overalls and \\r\\npulled them partly over her. Almost immediately they fell \\r\\nasleep and slept for about half an hour.\\r\\nWinston woke first. He sat up and watched the freck\\x02led face, still peacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of her \\r\\nhand. Except for her mouth, you could not call her beauti\\x02ful. There was a line or two round the eyes, if you looked \\r\\nclosely. The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and \\r\\nsoft. It occurred to him that he still did not know her sur\\x02name or where she lived.\\r\\nThe young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in \\r\\nhim a pitying, protecting feeling. But the mindless tender\\x02ness that he had felt under the hazel tree, while the thrush \\r\\nwas singing, had not quite come back. He pulled the over\\x02alls aside and studied her smooth white flank. In the old \\r\\ndays, he thought, a man looked at a girl’s body and saw that \\r\\nit was desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you \\r\\ncould not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emo\\x02tion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear \\r\\nand hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a \\r\\nvictory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a po\\x02litical act.\\n160 1984\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n‘\\r\\nWe can come here once again,’ said Julia. ‘It’s generally safe \\r\\nto use any hide-out twice. But not for another month or \\r\\ntwo, of course.’\\r\\nAs soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. She \\r\\nbecame alert and business-like, put her clothes on, knot\\x02ted the scarlet sash about her waist, and began arranging \\r\\nthe details of the journey home. It seemed natural to leave \\r\\nthis to her. She obviously had a practical cunning which \\r\\nWinston lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaus\\x02tive knowledge of the countryside round London, stored \\r\\naway from innumerable community hikes. The route she \\r\\ngave him was quite different from the one by which he had \\r\\ncome, and brought him out at a different railway station. \\r\\n‘Never go home the same way as you went out,’ she said, as \\r\\nthough enunciating an important general principle. She \\r\\nwould leave first, and Winston was to wait half an hour be\\x02fore following her.\\r\\nShe had named a place where they could meet after work, \\r\\nfour evenings hence. It was a street in one of the poorer \\r\\nquarters, where there was an open market which was gener\\x02ally crowded and noisy. She would be hanging about among \\r\\nthe stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing\\x02thread. If she judged that the coast was clear she would blow \\r\\nher nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 161\\r\\npast her without recognition. But with luck, in the middle \\r\\nof the crowd, it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour \\r\\nand arrange another meeting.\\r\\n‘And now I must go,’ she said as soon as he had mastered \\r\\nhis instructions. ‘I’m due back at nineteen-thirty. I’ve got to \\r\\nput in two hours for the Junior Anti-Sex League, handing \\r\\nout leaflets, or something. Isn’t it bloody? Give me a brush\\x02down, would you? Have I got any twigs in my hair? Are you \\r\\nsure? Then good-bye, my love, good-bye!’\\r\\nShe flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost vi\\x02olently, and a moment later pushed her way through the \\r\\nsaplings and disappeared into the wood with very little \\r\\nnoise. Even now he had not found out her surname or her \\r\\naddress. However, it made no difference, for it was incon\\x02ceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange any \\r\\nkind of written communication.\\r\\nAs it happened, they never went back to the clearing in \\r\\nthe wood. During the month of May there was only one \\r\\nfurther occasion on which they actually succeeded in mak\\x02ing love. That was in another hidlng-place known to Julia, \\r\\nthe belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch \\r\\nof country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years \\r\\nearlier. It was a good hiding-place when once you got there, \\r\\nbut the getting there was very dangerous. For the rest they \\r\\ncould meet only in the streets, in a different place every eve\\x02ning and never for more than half an hour at a time. In the \\r\\nstreet it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As they \\r\\ndrifted down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast \\r\\nand never looking at one another, they carried on a curi-\\n162 1984\\r\\nous, intermittent conversation which flicked on and off like \\r\\nthe beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence by \\r\\nthe approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a tele\\x02screen, then taken up again minutes later in the middle of \\r\\na sentence, then abruptly cut short as they parted at the \\r\\nagreed spot, then continued almost without introduction \\r\\non the following day. Julia appeared to be quite used to this \\r\\nkind of conversation, which she called ‘talking by instal\\x02ments’. She was also surprisingly adept at speaking without \\r\\nmoving her lips. Just once in almost a month of nightly \\r\\nmeetings they managed to exchange a kiss. They were pass\\x02ing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speak \\r\\nwhen they were away from the main streets) when there was \\r\\na deafening roar, the earth heaved, and the air darkened, \\r\\nand Winston found himself lying on his side, bruised and \\r\\nterrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at \\r\\nhand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia’s face a few centi\\x02metres from his own, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even \\r\\nher lips were white. She was dead! He clasped her against \\r\\nhim and found that he was kissing a live warm face. But \\r\\nthere was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips. \\r\\nBoth of their faces were thickly coated with plaster.\\r\\nThere were evenings when they reached their rendezvous \\r\\nand then had to walk past one another without a sign, be\\x02cause a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter \\r\\nwas hovering overhead. Even if it had been less dangerous, \\r\\nit would still have been difficult to find time to meet. Win\\x02ston’s working week was sixty hours, Julia’s was even longer, \\r\\nand their free days varied according to the pressure of work \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 163\\r\\nand did not often coincide. Julia, in any case, seldom had an \\r\\nevening completely free. She spent an astonishing amount \\r\\nof time in attending lectures and demonstrations, distrib\\x02uting literature for the junior Anti-Sex League, preparing \\r\\nbanners for Hate Week, making collections for the savings \\r\\ncampaign, and such-like activities. It paid, she said, it was \\r\\ncamouflage. If you kept the small rules, you could break the \\r\\nbig ones. She even induced Winston to mortgage yet an\\x02other of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part-time \\r\\nmunition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Par\\x02ty members. So, one evening every week, Winston spent \\r\\nfour hours of paralysing boredom, screwing together small \\r\\nbits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses, in a \\r\\ndraughty, ill-lit workshop where the knocking of hammers \\r\\nmingled drearily with the music of the telescreens.\\r\\nWhen they met in the church tower the gaps in their \\r\\nfragmentary conversation were filled up. It was a blazing af\\x02ternoon. The air in the little square chamber above the bells \\r\\nwas hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon \\r\\ndung. They sat talking for hours on the dusty, twig-littered \\r\\nfloor, one or other of them getting up from time to time to \\r\\ncast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no \\r\\none was coming.\\r\\nJulia was twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel with \\r\\nthirty other girls (’Always in the stink of women! How I \\r\\nhate women!’ she said parenthetically), and she worked, as \\r\\nhe had guessed, on the novel-writing machines in the Fic\\x02tion Department. She enjoyed her work, which consisted \\r\\nchiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky elec-\\n164 1984\\r\\ntric motor. She was ‘not clever’, but was fond of using her \\r\\nhands and felt at home with machinery. She could describe \\r\\nthe whole process of composing a novel, from the general \\r\\ndirective issued by the Planning Committee down to the \\r\\nfinal touching-up by the Rewrite Squad. But she was not in\\x02terested in the finished product. She ‘didn’t much care for \\r\\nreading,’ she said. Books were just a commodity that had to \\r\\nbe produced, like jam or bootlaces.\\r\\nShe had no memories of anything before the early six\\x02ties and the only person she had ever known who talked \\r\\nfrequently of the days before the Revolution was a grand\\x02father who had disappeared when she was eight. At school \\r\\nshe had been captain of the hockey team and had won the \\r\\ngymnastics trophy two years running. She had been a troop\\x02leader in the Spies and a branch secretary in the Youth \\r\\nLeague before joining the Junior Anti-Sex League. She had \\r\\nalways borne an excellent character. She had even (an infal\\x02lible mark of good reputation) been picked out to work in \\r\\nPornosec, the sub-section of the Fiction Department which \\r\\nturned out cheap pornography for distribution among the \\r\\nproles. It was nicknamed Muck House by the people who \\r\\nworked in it, she remarked. There she had remained for a \\r\\nyear, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with ti\\x02tles like ‘Spanking Stories’ or ‘One Night in a Girls’ School’, \\r\\nto be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were un\\x02der the impression that they were buying something illegal.\\r\\n‘What are these books like?’ said Winston curiously.\\r\\n‘Oh, ghastly rubbish. They’re boring, really. They only \\r\\nhave six plots, but they swap them round a bit. Of course \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 165\\r\\nI was only on the kaleidoscopes. I was never in the Rewrite \\r\\nSquad. I’m not literary, dear—not even enough for that.’\\r\\nHe learned with astonishment that all the workers in \\r\\nPornosec, except the heads of the departments, were girls. \\r\\nThe theory was that men, whose sex instincts were less con\\x02trollable than those of women, were in greater danger of \\r\\nbeing corrupted by the filth they handled.\\r\\n‘They don’t even like having married women there,’ she \\r\\nadded. Girls are always supposed to be so pure. Here’s one \\r\\nwho isn’t, anyway.\\r\\nShe had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen, \\r\\nwith a Party member of sixty who later committed suicide \\r\\nto avoid arrest. ‘And a good job too,’ said Julia, ‘otherwise \\r\\nthey’d have had my name out of him when he confessed.’ \\r\\nSince then there had been various others. Life as she saw it \\r\\nwas quite simple. You wanted a good time; ‘they’, meaning \\r\\nthe Party, wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules \\r\\nas best you could. She seemed to think it just as natural that \\r\\n‘they’ should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you \\r\\nshould want to avoid being caught. She hated the Party, and \\r\\nsaid so in the crudest words, but she made no general criti\\x02cism of it. Except where it touched upon her own life she \\r\\nhad no interest in Party doctrine. He noticed that she never \\r\\nused Newspeak words except the ones that had passed into \\r\\neveryday use. She had never heard of the Brotherhood, and \\r\\nrefused to believe in its existence. Any kind of organized \\r\\nrevolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure, \\r\\nstruck her as stupid. The clever thing was to break the rules \\r\\nand stay alive all the same. He wondered vaguely how many \\n166 1984\\r\\nothers like her there might be in the younger generation \\r\\npeople who had grown up in the world of the Revolution, \\r\\nknowing nothing else, accepting the Party as something \\r\\nunalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authority \\r\\nbut simply evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog.\\r\\nThey did not discuss the possibility of getting married. \\r\\nIt was too remote to be worth thinking about. No imagin\\x02able committee would ever sanction such a marriage even \\r\\nif Katharine, Winston’s wife, could somehow have been got \\r\\nrid of. It was hopeless even as a daydream.\\r\\n‘What was she like, your wife?’ said Julia.\\r\\n‘She was—do you know the Newspeak word GOOD\\x02THINKFUL? Meaning naturally orthodox, incapable of \\r\\nthinking a bad thought?’\\r\\n‘No, I didn’t know the word, but I know the kind of per\\x02son, right enough.’\\r\\nHe began telling her the story of his married life, but cu\\x02riously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of \\r\\nit already. She described to him, almost as though she had \\r\\nseen or felt it, the stiffening of Katharine’s body as soon \\r\\nas he touched her, the way in which she still seemed to be \\r\\npushing him from her with all her strength, even when her \\r\\narms were clasped tightly round him. With Julia he felt no \\r\\ndifficulty in talking about such things: Katharine, in any \\r\\ncase, had long ceased to be a painful memory and became \\r\\nmerely a distasteful one.\\r\\n‘I could have stood it if it hadn’t been for one thing,’ he \\r\\nsaid. He told her about the frigid little ceremony that Kath\\x02arine had forced him to go through on the same night every \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 167\\r\\nweek. ‘She hated it, but nothing would make her stop doing \\r\\nit. She used to call it—but you’ll never guess.’\\r\\n‘Our duty to the Party,’ said Julia promptly.\\r\\n‘How did you know that?’\\r\\n‘I’ve been at school too, dear. Sex talks once a month for \\r\\nthe over-sixteens. And in the Youth Movement. They rub it \\r\\ninto you for years. I dare say it works in a lot of cases. But of \\r\\ncourse you can never tell; people are such hypocrites.’\\r\\nShe began to enlarge upon the subject. With Julia, every\\x02thing came back to her own sexuality. As soon as this was \\r\\ntouched upon in any way she was capable of great acuteness. \\r\\nUnlike Winston, she had grasped the inner meaning of the \\r\\nParty’s sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sex \\r\\ninstinct created a world of its own which was outside the \\r\\nParty’s control and which therefore had to be destroyed if \\r\\npossible. What was more important was that sexual priva\\x02tion induced hysteria, which was desirable because it could \\r\\nbe transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The way \\r\\nshe put it was:\\r\\n‘When you make love you’re using up energy; and after\\x02wards you feel happy and don’t give a damn for anything. \\r\\nThey can’t bear you to feel like that. They want you to be \\r\\nbursting with energy all the time. All this marching up and \\r\\ndown and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. \\r\\nIf you’re happy inside yourself, why should you get excited \\r\\nabout Big Brother and the Three-Year Plans and the Two \\r\\nMinutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?’\\r\\nThat was very true, he thought. There was a direct inti\\x02mate connexion between chastity and political orthodoxy. \\n168 1984\\r\\nFor how could the fear, the hatred, and the lunatic credulity \\r\\nwhich the Party needed in its members be kept at the right \\r\\npitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct and \\r\\nusing it as a driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous to \\r\\nthe Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They had \\r\\nplayed a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood. The \\r\\nfamily could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, people \\r\\nwere encouraged to be fond of their children, in almost the \\r\\nold-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand, were \\r\\nsystematically turned against their parents and taught to \\r\\nspy on them and report their deviations. The family had \\r\\nbecome in effect an extension of the Thought Police. It was \\r\\na device by means of which everyone could be surrounded \\r\\nnight and day by informers who knew him intimately.\\r\\nAbruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharine \\r\\nwould unquestionably have denounced him to the Thought \\r\\nPolice if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect the \\r\\nunorthodoxy of his opinions. But what really recalled her \\r\\nto him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, \\r\\nwhich had brought the sweat out on his forehead. He began \\r\\ntelling Julia of something that had happened, or rather had \\r\\nfailed to happen, on another sweltering summer afternoon, \\r\\neleven years ago.\\r\\nIt was three or four months after they were married. They \\r\\nhad lost their way on a community hike somewhere in Kent. \\r\\nThey had only lagged behind the others for a couple of min\\x02utes, but they took a wrong turning, and presently found \\r\\nthemselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk \\r\\nquarry. It was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres, with \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 169\\r\\nboulders at the bottom. There was nobody of whom they \\r\\ncould ask the way. As soon as she realized that they were \\r\\nlost Katharine became very uneasy. To be away from the \\r\\nnoisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of \\r\\nwrong-doing. She wanted to hurry back by the way they had \\r\\ncome and start searching in the other direction. But at this \\r\\nmoment Winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing \\r\\nin the cracks of the cliff beneath them. One tuft was of two \\r\\ncolours, magenta and brick-red, apparently growing on the \\r\\nsame root. He had never seen anything of the kind before, \\r\\nand he called to Katharine to come and look at it.\\r\\n‘Look, Katharine! Look at those flowers. That clump \\r\\ndown near the bottom. Do you see they’re two different co\\x02lours?’\\r\\nShe had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully \\r\\ncome back for a moment. She even leaned out over the cliff \\r\\nface to see where he was pointing. He was standing a little \\r\\nbehind her, and he put his hand on her waist to steady her. \\r\\nAt this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely \\r\\nalone they were. There was not a human creature anywhere, \\r\\nnot a leaf stirring, not even a bird awake. In a place like \\r\\nthis the danger that there would be a hidden microphone \\r\\nwas very small, and even if there was a microphone it would \\r\\nonly pick up sounds. It was the hottest sleepiest hour of the \\r\\nafternoon. The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tick\\x02led his face. And the thought struck him...\\r\\n‘Why didn’t you give her a good shove?’ said Julia. ‘I \\r\\nwould have.’\\r\\n‘Yes, dear, you would have. I would, if I’d been the same \\n170 1984\\r\\nperson then as I am now. Or perhaps I would—I’m not cer\\x02tain.’\\r\\n‘Are you sorry you didn’t?’\\r\\n‘Yes. On the whole I’m sorry I didn’t.’\\r\\nThey were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. He \\r\\npulled her closer against him. Her head rested on his shoul\\x02der, the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeon \\r\\ndung. She was very young, he thought, she still expected \\r\\nsomething from life, she did not understand that to push an \\r\\ninconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing.\\r\\n‘Actually it would have made no difference,’ he said.\\r\\n‘Then why are you sorry you didn’t do it?’\\r\\n‘Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In this \\r\\ngame that we’re playing, we can’t win. Some kinds of failure \\r\\nare better than other kinds, that’s all.’\\r\\nHe felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. She al\\x02ways contradicted him when he said anything of this kind. \\r\\nShe would not accept it as a law of nature that the individ\\x02ual is always defeated. In a way she realized that she herself \\r\\nwas doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police would \\r\\ncatch her and kill her, but with another part of her mind \\r\\nshe believed that it was somehow possible to construct a se\\x02cret world in which you could live as you chose. All you \\r\\nneeded was luck and cunning and boldness. She did not un\\x02derstand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the \\r\\nonly victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead, \\r\\nthat from the moment of declaring war on the Party it was \\r\\nbetter to think of yourself as a corpse.\\r\\n‘We are the dead,’ he said.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 171\\r\\n‘We’re not dead yet,’ said Julia prosaically.\\r\\n‘Not physically. Six months, a year—five years, conceiv\\x02ably. I am afraid of death. You are young, so presumably \\r\\nyou’re more afraid of it than I am. Obviously we shall put it \\r\\noff as long as we can. But it makes very little difference. So \\r\\nlong as human beings stay human, death and life are the \\r\\nsame thing.’\\r\\n‘Oh, rubbish! Which would you sooner sleep with, me or \\r\\na skeleton? Don’t you enjoy being alive? Don’t you like feel\\x02ing: This is me, this is my hand, this is my leg, I’m real, I’m \\r\\nsolid, I’m alive! Don’t you like THIS?’\\r\\nShe twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against \\r\\nhim. He could feel her breasts, ripe yet firm, through her \\r\\noveralls. Her body seemed to be pouring some of its youth \\r\\nand vigour into his.\\r\\n‘Yes, I like that,’ he said.\\r\\n‘Then stop talking about dying. And now listen, dear, \\r\\nwe’ve got to fix up about the next time we meet. We may as \\r\\nwell go back to the place in the wood. We’ve given it a good \\r\\nlong rest. But you must get there by a different way this time. \\r\\nI’ve got it all planned out. You take the train—but look, I’ll \\r\\ndraw it out for you.’\\r\\nAnd in her practical way she scraped together a small \\r\\nsquare of dust, and with a twig from a pigeon’s nest began \\r\\ndrawing a map on the floor.\\n172 1984\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\nWinston looked round the shabby little room above Mr \\r\\nCharrington’s shop. Beside the window the enormous \\r\\nbed was made up, with ragged blankets and a coverless bol\\x02ster. The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was \\r\\nticking away on the mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gate\\x02leg table, the glass paperweight which he had bought on his \\r\\nlast visit gleamed softly out of the half-darkness.\\r\\nIn the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and \\r\\ntwo cups, provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the \\r\\nburner and set a pan of water to boil. He had brought an \\r\\nenvelope full of Victory Coffee and some saccharine tablets. \\r\\nThe clock’s hands said seventeen-twenty: it was nineteen\\x02twenty really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty.\\r\\nFolly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, \\r\\nsuicidal folly. Of all the crimes that a Party member could \\r\\ncommit, this one was the least possible to conceal. Actu\\x02ally the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a \\r\\nvision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of \\r\\nthe gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had \\r\\nmade no difficulty about letting the room. He was obviously \\r\\nglad of the few dollars that it would bring him. Nor did he \\r\\nseem shocked or become offensively knowing when it was \\r\\nmade clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose \\r\\nof a love-affair. Instead he looked into the middle distance \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 173\\r\\nand spoke in generalities, with so delicate an air as to give \\r\\nthe impression that he had become partly invisible. Privacy, \\r\\nhe said, was a very valuable thing. Everyone wanted a place \\r\\nwhere they could be alone occasionally. And when they had \\r\\nsuch a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else \\r\\nwho knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even, \\r\\nseeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so, add\\x02ed that there were two entries to the house, one of them \\r\\nthrough the back yard, which gave on an alley.\\r\\nUnder the window somebody was singing. Winston \\r\\npeeped out, secure in the protection of the muslin curtain. \\r\\nThe June sun was still high in the sky, and in the sun-filled \\r\\ncourt below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman pil\\x02lar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped \\r\\nabout her middle, was stumping to and fro between a wash\\x02tub and a clothes line, pegging out a series of square white \\r\\nthings which Winston recognized as babies’ diapers. When\\x02ever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was \\r\\nsinging in a powerful contralto:\\r\\nIt was only an ‘opeless fancy. \\r\\nIt passed like an Ipril dye, \\r\\nBut a look an’ a word an’ the dreams they stirred! \\r\\nThey ‘ave \\r\\nstolen my ‘eart awye!\\r\\nThe tune had been haunting London for weeks past. It \\r\\nwas one of countless similar songs published for the ben\\x02efit of the proles by a sub-section of the Music Department. \\n174 1984\\r\\nThe words of these songs were composed without any hu\\x02man intervention whatever on an instrument known as a \\r\\nversificator. But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the \\r\\ndreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound. He could \\r\\nhear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the \\r\\nflagstones, and the cries of the children in the street, and \\r\\nsomewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet \\r\\nthe room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of \\r\\na telescreen.\\r\\nFolly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceiv\\x02able that they could frequent this place for more than a few \\r\\nweeks without being caught. But the temptation of having a \\r\\nhiding-place that was truly their own, indoors and near at \\r\\nhand, had been too much for both of them. For some time \\r\\nafter their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible \\r\\nto arrange meetings. Working hours had been drastically \\r\\nincreased in anticipation of Hate Week. It was more than \\r\\na month distant, but the enormous, complex preparations \\r\\nthat it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody. \\r\\nFinally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on \\r\\nthe same day. They had agreed to go back to the clearing \\r\\nin the wood. On the evening beforehand they met briefly \\r\\nin the street. As usual, Winston hardly looked at Julia as \\r\\nthey drifted towards one another in the crowd, but from \\r\\nthe short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was \\r\\npaler than usual.\\r\\n‘It’s all off,’ she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to \\r\\nspeak. ‘Tomorrow, I mean.’\\r\\n‘What?’\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 175\\r\\n‘Tomorrow afternoon. I can’t come.’\\r\\n‘Why not?’\\r\\n‘Oh, the usual reason. It’s started early this time.’\\r\\nFor a moment he was violently angry. During the month \\r\\nthat he had known her the nature of his desire for her had \\r\\nchanged. At the beginning there had been little true sensu\\x02ality in it. Their first love-making had been simply an act \\r\\nof the will. But after the second time it was different. The \\r\\nsmell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her \\r\\nskin seemed to have got inside him, or into the air all round \\r\\nhim. She had become a physical necessity, something that \\r\\nhe not only wanted but felt that he had a right to. When she \\r\\nsaid that she could not come, he had the feeling that she was \\r\\ncheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed \\r\\nthem together and their hands accidentally met. She gave \\r\\nthe tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to in\\x02vite not desire but affection. It struck him that when one \\r\\nlived with a woman this particular disappointment must be \\r\\na normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as \\r\\nhe had not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He \\r\\nwished that they were a married couple of ten years’ stand\\x02ing. He wished that he were walking through the streets \\r\\nwith her just as they were doing now but openly and with\\x02out fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends \\r\\nfor the household. He wished above all that they had some \\r\\nplace where they could be alone together without feeling \\r\\nthe obligation to make love every time they met. It was not \\r\\nactually at that moment, but at some time on the following \\r\\nday, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington’s room had oc-\\n176 1984\\r\\ncurred to him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed \\r\\nwith unexpected readiness. Both of them knew that it was \\r\\nlunacy. It was as though they were intentionally stepping \\r\\nnearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the edge of the \\r\\nbed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love. \\r\\nIt was curious how that predestined horror moved in and \\r\\nout of one’s consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, \\r\\npreceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not \\r\\navoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it: and yet instead, \\r\\nevery now and again, by a conscious, wilful act, one chose \\r\\nto shorten the interval before it happened.\\r\\nAt this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia \\r\\nburst into the room. She was carrying a tool-bag of coarse \\r\\nbrown canvas, such as he had sometimes seen her carrying \\r\\nto and fro at the Ministry. He started forward to take her in \\r\\nhis arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly, partly \\r\\nbecause she was still holding the tool-bag.\\r\\n‘Half a second,’ she said. ‘Just let me show you what I’ve \\r\\nbrought. Did you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee? \\r\\nI thought you would. You can chuck it away again, because \\r\\nwe shan’t be needing it. Look here.’\\r\\nShe fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled \\r\\nout some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top part \\r\\nof it. Underneath were a number of neat paper packets. The \\r\\nfirst packet that she passed to Winston had a strange and \\r\\nyet vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind of \\r\\nheavy, sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touched \\r\\nit.\\r\\n‘It isn’t sugar?’ he said.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 177\\r\\n‘Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here’s a loaf of \\r\\nbread—proper white bread, not our bloody stuff—and a lit\\x02tle pot of jam. And here’s a tin of milk—but look! This is the \\r\\none I’m really proud of. I had to wrap a bit of sacking round \\r\\nit, because——’\\r\\nBut she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it \\r\\nup. The smell was already filling the room, a rich hot smell \\r\\nwhich seemed like an emanation from his early childhood, \\r\\nbut which one did occasionally meet with even now, blow\\x02ing down a passage-way before a door slammed, or diffusing \\r\\nitself mysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant \\r\\nand then lost again.\\r\\n‘It’s coffee,’ he murmured, ‘real coffee.’\\r\\n‘It’s Inner Party coffee. There’s a whole kilo here,’ she \\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n‘How did you manage to get hold of all these things?’\\r\\n‘It’s all Inner Party stuff. There’s nothing those swine \\r\\ndon’t have, nothing. But of course waiters and servants and \\r\\npeople pinch things, and—look, I got a little packet of tea \\r\\nas well.’\\r\\nWinston had squatted down beside her. He tore open a \\r\\ncorner of the packet.\\r\\n‘It’s real tea. Not blackberry leaves.’\\r\\n‘There’s been a lot of tea about lately. They’ve captured In\\x02dia, or something,’ she said vaguely. ‘But listen, dear. I want \\r\\nyou to turn your back on me for three minutes. Go and sit \\r\\non the other side of the bed. Don’t go too near the window. \\r\\nAnd don’t turn round till I tell you.’\\r\\nWinston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain. \\n178 1984\\r\\nDown in the yard the red-armed woman was still marching \\r\\nto and fro between the washtub and the line. She took two \\r\\nmore pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling:\\r\\nThey sye that time ‘eals all things, \\r\\nThey sye you can always forget; \\r\\nBut the smiles an’ the tears acrorss the years \\r\\nThey twist my \\r\\n‘eart-strings yet!\\r\\nShe knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed. \\r\\nHer voice floated upward with the sweet summer air, very \\r\\ntuneful, charged with a sort of happy melancholy. One had \\r\\nthe feeling that she would have been perfectly content, if the \\r\\nJune evening had been endless and the supply of clothes in\\x02exhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging \\r\\nout diapers and singing rubbish. It struck him as a curious \\r\\nfact that he had never heard a member of the Party singing \\r\\nalone and spontaneously. It would even have seemed slightly \\r\\nunorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to one\\x02self. Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near \\r\\nthe starvation level that they had anything to sing about.\\r\\n‘You can turn round now,’ said Julia.\\r\\nHe turned round, and for a second almost failed to rec\\x02ognize her. What he had actually expected was to see her \\r\\nnaked. But she was not naked. The transformation that had \\r\\nhappened was much more surprising than that. She had \\r\\npainted her face.\\r\\nShe must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 179\\r\\nquarters and bought herself a complete set of make-up ma\\x02terials. Her lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged, \\r\\nher nose powdered; there was even a touch of something \\r\\nunder the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skil\\x02fully done, but Winston’s standards in such matters were \\r\\nnot high. He had never before seen or imagined a woman of \\r\\nthe Party with cosmetics on her face. The improvement in \\r\\nher appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colour \\r\\nin the right places she had become not only very much pret\\x02tier, but, above all, far more feminine. Her short hair and \\r\\nboyish overalls merely added to the effect. As he took her in \\r\\nhis arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils. He \\r\\nremembered the half-darkness of a basement kitchen, and a \\r\\nwoman’s cavernous mouth. It was the very same scent that \\r\\nshe had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.\\r\\n‘Scent too!’ he said.\\r\\n‘Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I’m going to \\r\\ndo next? I’m going to get hold of a real woman’s frock from \\r\\nsomewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers. I’ll \\r\\nwear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes! In this room I’m \\r\\ngoing to be a woman, not a Party comrade.’\\r\\nThey flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge \\r\\nmahogany bed. It was the first time that he had stripped \\r\\nhimself naked in her presence. Until now he had been too \\r\\nmuch ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with the vari\\x02cose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured \\r\\npatch over his ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanket \\r\\nthey lay on was threadbare and smooth, and the size and \\r\\nspringiness of the bed astonished both of them. ‘It’s sure \\n180 1984\\r\\nto be full of bugs, but who cares?’ said Julia. One never saw \\r\\na double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles. \\r\\nWinston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Julia \\r\\nhad never been in one before, so far as she could remember.\\r\\nPresently they fell asleep for a little while. When Win\\x02ston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to \\r\\nnearly nine. He did not stir, because Julia was sleeping with \\r\\nher head in the crook of his arm. Most of her make-up had \\r\\ntransferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light \\r\\nstain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. \\r\\nA yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the \\r\\nbed and lighted up the fireplace, where the water in the pan \\r\\nwas boiling fast. Down in the yard the woman had stopped \\r\\nsinging, but the faint shouts of children floated in from the \\r\\nstreet. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past \\r\\nit had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in \\r\\nthe cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman with no \\r\\nclothes on, making love when they chose, talking of what \\r\\nthey chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply ly\\x02ing there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely \\r\\nthere could never have been a time when that seemed ordi\\x02nary? Julia woke up, rubbed her eyes, and raised herself on \\r\\nher elbow to look at the oilstove.\\r\\n‘Half that water’s boiled away,’ she said. ‘I’ll get up and \\r\\nmake some coffee in another moment. We’ve got an hour. \\r\\nWhat time do they cut the lights off at your flats?’\\r\\n‘Twenty-three thirty.’\\r\\n‘It’s twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to get in ear\\x02lier than that, because—Hi! Get out, you filthy brute!’\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 181\\r\\nShe suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a \\r\\nshoe from the floor, and sent it hurtling into the corner with \\r\\na boyish jerk of her arm, exactly as he had seen her fling the \\r\\ndictionary at Goldstein, that morning during the Two Min\\x02utes Hate.\\r\\n‘What was it?’ he said in surprise.\\r\\n‘A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wain\\x02scoting. There’s a hole down there. I gave him a good fright, \\r\\nanyway.’\\r\\n‘Rats!’ murmured Winston. ‘In this room!’\\r\\n‘They’re all over the place,’ said Julia indifferently as she \\r\\nlay down again. ‘We’ve even got them in the kitchen at the \\r\\nhostel. Some parts of London are swarming with them. Did \\r\\nyou know they attack children? Yes, they do. In some of \\r\\nthese streets a woman daren’t leave a baby alone for two \\r\\nminutes. It’s the great huge brown ones that do it. And the \\r\\nnasty thing is that the brutes always——’\\r\\n‘DON’T GO ON!’ said Winston, with his eyes tightly \\r\\nshut.\\r\\n‘Dearest! You’ve gone quite pale. What’s the matter? Do \\r\\nthey make you feel sick?’\\r\\n‘Of all horrors in the world—a rat!’\\r\\nShe pressed herself against him and wound her limbs \\r\\nround him, as though to reassure him with the warmth \\r\\nof her body. He did not reopen his eyes immediately. For \\r\\nseveral moments he had had the feeling of being back in a \\r\\nnightmare which had recurred from time to time through\\x02out his life. It was always very much the same. He was \\r\\nstanding in front of a wall of darkness, and on the other \\n182 1984\\r\\nside of it there was something unendurable, something too \\r\\ndreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was \\r\\nalways one of self-deception, because he did in fact know \\r\\nwhat was behind the wall of darkness. With a deadly effort, \\r\\nlike wrenching a piece out of his own brain, he could even \\r\\nhave dragged the thing into the open. He always woke up \\r\\nwithout discovering what it was: but somehow it was con\\x02nected with what Julia had been saying when he cut her \\r\\nshort.\\r\\n‘I’m sorry,’ he said, ‘it’s nothing. I don’t like rats, that’s \\r\\nall.’\\r\\n‘Don’t worry, dear, we’re not going to have the filthy \\r\\nbrutes in here. I’ll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before \\r\\nwe go. And next time we come here I’ll bring some plaster \\r\\nand bung it up properly.’\\r\\nAlready the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. \\r\\nFeeling slightly ashamed of himself, he sat up against the \\r\\nbedhead. Julia got out of bed, pulled on her overalls, and \\r\\nmade the coffee. The smell that rose from the saucepan was \\r\\nso powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest \\r\\nanybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive. \\r\\nWhat was even better than the taste of the coffee was the \\r\\nsilky texture given to it by the sugar, a thing Winston had \\r\\nalmost forgotten after years of saccharine. With one hand \\r\\nin her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other, Ju\\x02lia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the \\r\\nbookcase, pointing out the best way of repairing the gate\\x02leg table, plumping herself down in the ragged arm-chair to \\r\\nsee if it was comfortable, and examining the absurd twelve-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 183\\r\\nhour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. She brought \\r\\nthe glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a \\r\\nbetter light. He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, \\r\\nby the soft, rainwatery appearance of the glass.\\r\\n‘What is it, do you think?’ said Julia.\\r\\n‘I don’t think it’s anything—I mean, I don’t think it was \\r\\never put to any use. That’s what I like about it. It’s a little \\r\\nchunk of history that they’ve forgotten to alter. It’s a mes\\x02sage from a hundred years ago, if one knew how to read it.’\\r\\n‘And that picture over there’—she nodded at the engrav\\x02ing on the opposite wall—’would that be a hundred years \\r\\nold?’\\r\\n‘More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can’t tell. It’s impos\\x02sible to discover the age of anything nowadays.’\\r\\nShe went over to look at it. ‘Here’s where that brute stuck \\r\\nhis nose out,’ she said, kicking the wainscoting immediate\\x02ly below the picture. ‘What is this place? I’ve seen it before \\r\\nsomewhere.’\\r\\n‘It’s a church, or at least it used to be. St Clement Danes \\r\\nits name was.’ The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington \\r\\nhad taught him came back into his head, and he added \\r\\nhalf-nostalgically: ‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St \\r\\nClement’s!’\\r\\nTo his astonishment she capped the line:\\r\\n’You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin’s, \\r\\nWhen will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey——’\\r\\n‘I can’t remember how it goes on after that. But anyway \\n184 1984\\r\\nI remember it ends up, ‘Here comes a candle to light you to \\r\\nbed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head!‘‘\\r\\nIt was like the two halves of a countersign. But there \\r\\nmust be another line after ‘the bells of Old Bailey’. Perhaps \\r\\nit could be dug out of Mr Charrington’s memory, if he were \\r\\nsuitably prompted.\\r\\n‘Who taught you that?’ he said.\\r\\n‘My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a lit\\x02tle girl. He was vaporized when I was eight—at any rate, he \\r\\ndisappeared. I wonder what a lemon was,’ she added incon\\x02sequently. ‘I’ve seen oranges. They’re a kind of round yellow \\r\\nfruit with a thick skin.’\\r\\n‘I can remember lemons,’ said Winston. ‘They were quite \\r\\ncommon in the fifties. They were so sour that it set your \\r\\nteeth on edge even to smell them.’\\r\\n‘I bet that picture’s got bugs behind it,’ said Julia. ‘I’ll \\r\\ntake it down and give it a good clean some day. I suppose \\r\\nit’s almost time we were leaving. I must start washing this \\r\\npaint off. What a bore! I’ll get the lipstick off your face af\\x02terwards.’\\r\\nWinston did not get up for a few minutes more. The \\r\\nroom was darkening. He turned over towards the light and \\r\\nlay gazing into the glass paperweight. The inexhaustibly \\r\\ninteresting thing was not the fragment of coral but the in\\x02terior of the glass itself. There was such a depth of it, and \\r\\nyet it was almost as transparent as air. It was as though the \\r\\nsurface of the glass had been the arch of the sky, enclosing \\r\\na tiny world with its atmosphere complete. He had the feel\\x02ing that he could get inside it, and that in fact he was inside \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 185\\r\\nit, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table, and \\r\\nthe clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself. \\r\\nThe paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was \\r\\nJulia’s life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart \\r\\nof the crystal.\\n186 1984\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\nSyme had vanished. A morning came, and he was miss\\x02ing from work: a few thoughtless people commented on \\r\\nhis absence. On the next day nobody mentioned him. On \\r\\nthe third day Winston went into the vestibule of the Re\\x02cords Department to look at the notice-board. One of the \\r\\nnotices carried a printed list of the members of the Chess \\r\\nCommittee, of whom Syme had been one. It looked almost \\r\\nexactly as it had looked before—nothing had been crossed \\r\\nout—but it was one name shorter. It was enough. Syme had \\r\\nceased to exist: he had never existed.\\r\\nThe weather was baking hot. In the labyrinthine Ministry \\r\\nthe windowless, air-conditioned rooms kept their normal \\r\\ntemperature, but outside the pavements scorched one’s feet \\r\\nand the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours was a hor\\x02ror. The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, and \\r\\nthe staffs of all the Ministries were working overtime. Pro\\x02cessions, meetings, military parades, lectures, waxworks, \\r\\ndisplays, film shows, telescreen programmes all had to be \\r\\norganized; stands had to be erected, effigies built, slogans \\r\\ncoined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographs \\r\\nfaked. Julia’s unit in the Fiction Department had been tak\\x02en off the production of novels and was rushing out a series \\r\\nof atrocity pamphlets. Winston, in addition to his regular \\r\\nwork, spent long periods every day in going through back \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 187\\r\\nfiles of ‘The Times’ and altering and embellishing news \\r\\nitems which were to be quoted in speeches. Late at night, \\r\\nwhen crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets, the town \\r\\nhad a curiously febrile air. The rocket bombs crashed of\\x02tener than ever, and sometimes in the far distance there \\r\\nwere enormous explosions which no one could explain and \\r\\nabout which there were wild rumours.\\r\\nThe new tune which was to be the theme-song of Hate \\r\\nWeek (the Hate Song, it was called) had already been com\\x02posed and was being endlessly plugged on the telescreens. \\r\\nIt had a savage, barking rhythm which could not exactly be \\r\\ncalled music, but resembled the beating of a drum. Roared \\r\\nout by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, it \\r\\nwas terrifying. The proles had taken a fancy to it, and in the \\r\\nmidnight streets it competed with the still-popular ‘It was \\r\\nonly a hopeless fancy’. The Parsons children played it at all \\r\\nhours of the night and day, unbearably, on a comb and a \\r\\npiece of toilet paper. Winston’s evenings were fuller than \\r\\never. Squads of volunteers, organized by Parsons, were pre\\x02paring the street for Hate Week, stitching banners, painting \\r\\nposters, erecting flagstaffs on the roofs, and perilously sling\\x02ing wires across the street for the reception of streamers. \\r\\nParsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would display \\r\\nfour hundred metres of bunting. He was in his native ele\\x02ment and as happy as a lark. The heat and the manual work \\r\\nhad even given him a pretext for reverting to shorts and \\r\\nan open shirt in the evenings. He was everywhere at once, \\r\\npushing, pulling, sawing, hammering, improvising, jolly\\x02ing everyone along with comradely exhortations and giving \\n188 1984\\r\\nout from every fold of his body what seemed an inexhaust\\x02ible supply of acrid-smelling sweat.\\r\\nA new poster had suddenly appeared all over London. It \\r\\nhad no caption, and represented simply the monstrous fig\\x02ure of a Eurasian soldier, three or four metres high, striding \\r\\nforward with expressionless Mongolian face and enor\\x02mous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. From \\r\\nwhatever angle you looked at the poster, the muzzle of the \\r\\ngun, magnified by the foreshortening, seemed to be point\\x02ed straight at you. The thing had been plastered on every \\r\\nblank space on every wall, even outnumbering the por\\x02traits of Big Brother. The proles, normally apathetic about \\r\\nthe war, were being lashed into one of their periodical fren\\x02zies of patriotism. As though to harmonize with the general \\r\\nmood, the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers \\r\\nof people than usual. One fell on a crowded film theatre in \\r\\nStepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins. \\r\\nThe whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for \\r\\na long, trailing funeral which went on for hours and was in \\r\\neffect an indignation meeting. Another bomb fell on a piece \\r\\nof waste ground which was used as a playground and sever\\x02al dozen children were blown to pieces. There were further \\r\\nangry demonstrations, Goldstein was burned in effigy, hun\\x02dreds of copies of the poster of the Eurasian soldier were \\r\\ntorn down and added to the flames, and a number of shops \\r\\nwere looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew round that \\r\\nspies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless \\r\\nwaves, and an old couple who were suspected of being of \\r\\nforeign extraction had their house set on fire and perished \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 189\\r\\nof suffocation.\\r\\nIn the room over Mr Charrington’s shop, when they could \\r\\nget there, Julia and Winston lay side by side on a stripped \\r\\nbed under the open window, naked for the sake of coolness. \\r\\nThe rat had never come back, but the bugs had multiplied \\r\\nhideously in the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty or \\r\\nclean, the room was paradise. As soon as they arrived they \\r\\nwould sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black \\r\\nmarket, tear off their clothes, and make love with sweating \\r\\nbodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs had \\r\\nrallied and were massing for the counter-attack.\\r\\nFour, five, six—seven times they met during the month \\r\\nof June. Winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at \\r\\nall hours. He seemed to have lost the need for it. He had \\r\\ngrown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided, leaving only \\r\\na brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of cough\\x02ing in the early morning had stopped. The process of life \\r\\nhad ceased to be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse \\r\\nto make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of \\r\\nhis voice. Now that they had a secure hiding-place, almost a \\r\\nhome, it did not even seem a hardship that they could only \\r\\nmeet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time. What \\r\\nmattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist. \\r\\nTo know that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as \\r\\nbeing in it. The room was a world, a pocket of the past where \\r\\nextinct animals could walk. Mr Charrington, thought Win\\x02ston, was another extinct animal. He usually stopped to talk \\r\\nwith Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs. \\r\\nThe old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors, \\n190 1984\\r\\nand on the other hand to have almost no customers. He \\r\\nled a ghostlike existence between the tiny, dark shop, and \\r\\nan even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his meals \\r\\nand which contained, among other things, an unbelievably \\r\\nancient gramophone with an enormous horn. He seemed \\r\\nglad of the opportunity to talk. Wandering about among \\r\\nhis worthless stock, with his long nose and thick spectacles \\r\\nand his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had always \\r\\nvaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman. \\r\\nWith a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap \\r\\nof rubbish or that—a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of \\r\\na broken snuffbox, a pinchbeck locket containing a strand \\r\\nof some long-dead baby’s hair—never asking that Winston \\r\\nshould buy it, merely that he should admire it. To talk to \\r\\nhim was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical\\x02box. He had dragged out from the corners of his memory \\r\\nsome more fragments of forgotten rhymes. There was one \\r\\nabout four and twenty blackbirds, and another about a cow \\r\\nwith a crumpled horn, and another about the death of poor \\r\\nCock Robin. ‘It just occurred to me you might be interested,’ \\r\\nhe would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he \\r\\nproduced a new fragment. But he could never recall more \\r\\nthan a few lines of any one rhyme.\\r\\nBoth of them knew—in a way, it was never out of their \\r\\nminds that what was now happening could not last long. \\r\\nThere were times when the fact of impending death seemed \\r\\nas palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would cling to\\x02gether with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned \\r\\nsoul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 191\\r\\nis within five minutes of striking. But there were also times \\r\\nwhen they had the illusion not only of safety but of per\\x02manence. So long as they were actually in this room, they \\r\\nboth felt, no harm could come to them. Getting there was \\r\\ndifficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. \\r\\nIt was as when Winston had gazed into the heart of the pa\\x02perweight, with the feeling that it would be possible to get \\r\\ninside that glassy world, and that once inside it time could \\r\\nbe arrested. Often they gave themselves up to daydreams of \\r\\nescape. Their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would \\r\\ncarry on their intrigue, just like this, for the remainder of \\r\\ntheir natural lives. Or Katharine would die, and by subtle \\r\\nmanoeuvrings Winston and Julia would succeed in get\\x02ting married. Or they would commit suicide together. Or \\r\\nthey would disappear, alter themselves out of recognition, \\r\\nlearn to speak with proletarian accents, get jobs in a factory \\r\\nand live out their lives undetected in a back-street. It was \\r\\nall nonsense, as they both knew. In reality there was no es\\x02cape. Even the one plan that was practicable, suicide, they \\r\\nhad no intention of carrying out. To hang on from day to \\r\\nday and from week to week, spinning out a present that had \\r\\nno future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one’s \\r\\nlungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is \\r\\nair available.\\r\\nSometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebel\\x02lion against the Party, but with no notion of how to take \\r\\nthe first step. Even if the fabulous Brotherhood was a real\\x02ity, there still remained the difficulty of finding one’s way \\r\\ninto it. He told her of the strange intimacy that existed, or \\n192 1984\\r\\nseemed to exist, between himself and O’Brien, and of the \\r\\nimpulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into O’Brien’s \\r\\npresence, announce that he was the enemy of the Party, and \\r\\ndemand his help. Curiously enough, this did not strike her \\r\\nas an impossibly rash thing to do. She was used to judg\\x02ing people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that \\r\\nWinston should believe O’Brien to be trustworthy on the \\r\\nstrength of a single flash of the eyes. Moreover she took it \\r\\nfor granted that everyone, or nearly everyone, secretly hated \\r\\nthe Party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to \\r\\ndo so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organized \\r\\nopposition existed or could exist. The tales about Goldstein \\r\\nand his underground army, she said, were simply a lot of \\r\\nrubbish which the Party had invented for its own purposes \\r\\nand which you had to pretend to believe in. Times beyond \\r\\nnumber, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations, \\r\\nshe had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of \\r\\npeople whose names she had never heard and in whose sup\\x02posed crimes she had not the faintest belief. When public \\r\\ntrials were happening she had taken her place in the detach\\x02ments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts \\r\\nfrom morning to night, chanting at intervals ‘Death to the \\r\\ntraitors!’ During the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled \\r\\nall others in shouting insults at Goldstein. Yet she had only \\r\\nthe dimmest idea of who Goldstein was and what doctrines \\r\\nhe was supposed to represent. She had grown up since the \\r\\nRevolution and was too young to remember the ideological \\r\\nbattles of the fifties and sixties. Such a thing as an indepen\\x02dent political movement was outside her imagination: and \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 193\\r\\nin any case the Party was invincible. It would always ex\\x02ist, and it would always be the same. You could only rebel \\r\\nagainst it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts \\r\\nof violence such as killing somebody or blowing something \\r\\nup.\\r\\nIn some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and \\r\\nfar less susceptible to Party propaganda. Once when he \\r\\nhappened in some connexion to mention the war against \\r\\nEurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opin\\x02ion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell \\r\\ndaily on London were probably fired by the Government \\r\\nof Oceania itself, ‘just to keep people frightened’. This was \\r\\nan idea that had literally never occurred to him. She also \\r\\nstirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the \\r\\nTwo Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting \\r\\nout laughing. But she only questioned the teachings of the \\r\\nParty when they in some way touched upon her own life. \\r\\nOften she was ready to accept the official mythology, simply \\r\\nbecause the difference between truth and falsehood did not \\r\\nseem important to her. She believed, for instance, having \\r\\nlearnt it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. \\r\\n(In his own schooldays, Winston remembered, in the late \\r\\nfifties, it was only the helicopter that the Party claimed to \\r\\nhave invented; a dozen years later, when Julia was at school, \\r\\nit was already claiming the aeroplane; one generation more, \\r\\nand it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when he \\r\\ntold her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was \\r\\nborn and long before the Revolution, the fact struck her as \\r\\ntotally uninteresting. After all, what did it matter who had \\n194 1984\\r\\ninvented aeroplanes? It was rather more of a shock to him \\r\\nwhen he discovered from some chance remark that she did \\r\\nnot remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war \\r\\nwith Eastasia and at peace with Eurasia. It was true that she \\r\\nregarded the whole war as a sham: but apparently she had \\r\\nnot even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed. \\r\\n‘I thought we’d always been at war with Eurasia,’ she said \\r\\nvaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aero\\x02planes dated from long before her birth, but the switchover \\r\\nin the war had happened only four years ago, well after she \\r\\nwas grown up. He argued with her about it for perhaps a \\r\\nquarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcing her \\r\\nmemory back until she did dimly recall that at one time \\r\\nEastasia and not Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue \\r\\nstill struck her as unimportant. ‘Who cares?’ she said im\\x02patiently. ‘It’s always one bloody war after another, and one \\r\\nknows the news is all lies anyway.’\\r\\nSometimes he talked to her of the Records Department \\r\\nand the impudent forgeries that he committed there. Such \\r\\nthings did not appear to horrify her. She did not feel the \\r\\nabyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becom\\x02ing truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, and \\r\\nRutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had \\r\\nonce held between his fingers. It did not make much im\\x02pression on her. At first, indeed, she failed to grasp the point \\r\\nof the story.\\r\\n‘Were they friends of yours?’ she said.\\r\\n‘No, I never knew them. They were Inner Party members. \\r\\nBesides, they were far older men than I was. They belonged \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 195\\r\\nto the old days, before the Revolution. I barely knew them \\r\\nby sight.’\\r\\n‘Then what was there to worry about? People are being \\r\\nkilled off all the time, aren’t they?’\\r\\nHe tried to make her understand. ‘This was an excep\\x02tional case. It wasn’t just a question of somebody being \\r\\nkilled. Do you realize that the past, starting from yester\\x02day, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, \\r\\nit’s in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, \\r\\nlike that lump of glass there. Already we know almost lit\\x02erally nothing about the Revolution and the years before \\r\\nthe Revolution. Every record has been destroyed or falsi\\x02fied, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been \\r\\nrepainted, every statue and street and building has been \\r\\nrenamed, every date has been altered. And that process is \\r\\ncontinuing day by day and minute by minute. History has \\r\\nstopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which \\r\\nthe Party is always right. I know, of course, that the past is \\r\\nfalsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, \\r\\neven when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is \\r\\ndone, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence is inside \\r\\nmy own mind, and I don’t know with any certainty that any \\r\\nother human being shares my memories. Just in that one \\r\\ninstance, in my whole life, I did possess actual concrete evi\\x02dence after the event—years after it.’\\r\\n‘And what good was that?’\\r\\n‘It was no good, because I threw it away a few minutes lat\\x02er. But if the same thing happened today, I should keep it.’\\r\\n‘Well, I wouldn’t!’ said Julia. ‘I’m quite ready to take \\n196 1984\\r\\nrisks, but only for something worth while, not for bits of \\r\\nold newspaper. What could you have done with it even if \\r\\nyou had kept it?’\\r\\n‘Not much, perhaps. But it was evidence. It might have \\r\\nplanted a few doubts here and there, supposing that I’d \\r\\ndared to show it to anybody. I don’t imagine that we can \\r\\nalter anything in our own lifetime. But one can imagine lit\\x02tle knots of resistance springing up here and there—small \\r\\ngroups of people banding themselves together, and gradu\\x02ally growing, and even leaving a few records behind, so that \\r\\nthe next generations can carry on where we leave off.’\\r\\n‘I’m not interested in the next generation, dear. I’m inter\\x02ested in US.’\\r\\n‘You’re only a rebel from the waist downwards,’ he told \\r\\nher.\\r\\nShe thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms \\r\\nround him in delight.\\r\\nIn the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the \\r\\nfaintest interest. Whenever he began to talk of the princi\\x02ples of Ingsoc, doublethink, the mutability of the past, and \\r\\nthe denial of objective reality, and to use Newspeak words, \\r\\nshe became bored and confused and said that she never paid \\r\\nany attention to that kind of thing. One knew that it was all \\r\\nrubbish, so why let oneself be worried by it? She knew when \\r\\nto cheer and when to boo, and that was all one needed. If he \\r\\npersisted in talking of such subjects, she had a disconcerting \\r\\nhabit of falling asleep. She was one of those people who can \\r\\ngo to sleep at any hour and in any position. Talking to her, \\r\\nhe realized how easy it was to present an appearance of or-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 197\\r\\nthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy \\r\\nmeant. In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself \\r\\nmost successfully on people incapable of understanding it. \\r\\nThey could be made to accept the most flagrant violations \\r\\nof reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity \\r\\nof what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently \\r\\ninterested in public events to notice what was happening. \\r\\nBy lack of understanding they remained sane. They simply \\r\\nswallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them \\r\\nno harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of \\r\\ncorn will pass undigested through the body of a bird.\\n198 1984\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\nI\\r\\nt had happened at last. The expected message had come. \\r\\nAll his life, it seemed to him, he had been waiting for this \\r\\nto happen.\\r\\nHe was walking down the long corridor at the Minis\\x02try and he was almost at the spot where Julia had slipped \\r\\nthe note into his hand when he became aware that some\\x02one larger than himself was walking just behind him. The \\r\\nperson, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a \\r\\nprelude to speaking. Winston stopped abruptly and turned. \\r\\nIt was O’Brien.\\r\\nAt last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only \\r\\nimpulse was to run away. His heart bounded violently. He \\r\\nwould have been incapable of speaking. O’Brien, however, \\r\\nhad continued forward in the same movement, laying a \\r\\nfriendly hand for a moment on Winston’s arm, so that the \\r\\ntwo of them were walking side by side. He began speak\\x02ing with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him \\r\\nfrom the majority of Inner Party members.\\r\\n‘I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,’ \\r\\nhe said. ‘I was reading one of your Newspeak articles in \\r\\n‘The Times’ the other day. You take a scholarly interest in \\r\\nNewspeak, I believe?’\\r\\nWinston had recovered part of his self-possession. \\r\\n‘Hardly scholarly,’ he said. ‘I’m only an amateur. It’s not my \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 199\\r\\nsubject. I have never had anything to do with the actual \\r\\nconstruction of the language.’\\r\\n‘But you write it very elegantly,’ said O’Brien. ‘That is not \\r\\nonly my own opinion. I was talking recently to a friend of \\r\\nyours who is certainly an expert. His name has slipped my \\r\\nmemory for the moment.’\\r\\nAgain Winston’s heart stirred painfully. It was incon\\x02ceivable that this was anything other than a reference to \\r\\nSyme. But Syme was not only dead, he was abolished, an \\r\\nunperson. Any identifiable reference to him would have \\r\\nbeen mortally dangerous. O’Brien’s remark must obviously \\r\\nhave been intended as a signal, a codeword. By sharing a \\r\\nsmall act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them \\r\\ninto accomplices. They had continued to stroll slowly down \\r\\nthe corridor, but now O’Brien halted. With the curious, dis\\x02arming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the \\r\\ngesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose. Then he went \\r\\non:\\r\\n‘What I had really intended to say was that in your article \\r\\nI noticed you had used two words which have become obso\\x02lete. But they have only become so very recently. Have you \\r\\nseen the tenth edition of the Newspeak Dictionary?’\\r\\n‘No,’ said Winston. ‘I didn’t think it had been issued yet. \\r\\nWe are still using the ninth in the Records Department.’\\r\\n‘The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months, \\r\\nI believe. But a few advance copies have been circulated. \\r\\nI have one myself. It might interest you to look at it, per\\x02haps?’\\r\\n‘Very much so,’ said Winston, immediately seeing where \\n200 1984\\r\\nthis tended.\\r\\n‘Some of the new developments are most ingenious. The \\r\\nreduction in the number of verbs—that is the point that will \\r\\nappeal to you, I think. Let me see, shall I send a messenger \\r\\nto you with the dictionary? But I am afraid I invariably for\\x02get anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pick it up at \\r\\nmy flat at some time that suited you? Wait. Let me give you \\r\\nmy address.’\\r\\nThey were standing in front of a telescreen. Somewhat \\r\\nabsentmindedly O’Brien felt two of his pockets and then \\r\\nproduced a small leather-covered notebook and a gold \\r\\nink-pencil. Immediately beneath the telescreen, in such a \\r\\nposition that anyone who was watching at the other end of \\r\\nthe instrument could read what he was writing, he scribbled \\r\\nan address, tore out the page and handed it to Winston.\\r\\n‘I am usually at home in the evenings,’ he said. ‘If not, my \\r\\nservant will give you the dictionary.’\\r\\nHe was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper, \\r\\nwhich this time there was no need to conceal. Nevertheless \\r\\nhe carefully memorized what was written on it, and some \\r\\nhours later dropped it into the memory hole along with a \\r\\nmass of other papers.\\r\\nThey had been talking to one another for a couple of \\r\\nminutes at the most. There was only one meaning that the \\r\\nepisode could possibly have. It had been contrived as a way \\r\\nof letting Winston know O’Brien’s address. This was neces\\x02sary, because except by direct enquiry it was never possible \\r\\nto discover where anyone lived. There were no directories \\r\\nof any kind. ‘If you ever want to see me, this is where I can \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 201\\r\\nbe found,’ was what O’Brien had been saying to him. Per\\x02haps there would even be a message concealed somewhere \\r\\nin the dictionary. But at any rate, one thing was certain. The \\r\\nconspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and he had \\r\\nreached the outer edges of it.\\r\\nHe knew that sooner or later he would obey O’Brien’s \\r\\nsummons. Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps after a long de\\x02lay—he was not certain. What was happening was only the \\r\\nworking-out of a process that had started years ago. The \\r\\nfirst step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the sec\\x02ond had been the opening of the diary. He had moved from \\r\\nthoughts to words, and now from words to actions. The last \\r\\nstep was something that would happen in the Ministry of \\r\\nLove. He had accepted it. The end was contained in the be\\x02ginning. But it was frightening: or, more exactly, it was like \\r\\na foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. Even while \\r\\nhe was speaking to O’Brien, when the meaning of the words \\r\\nhad sunk in, a chilly shuddering feeling had taken posses\\x02sion of his body. He had the sensation of stepping into the \\r\\ndampness of a grave, and it was not much better because \\r\\nhe had always known that the grave was there and waiting \\r\\nfor him.\\n202 1984\\r\\nChapter 7\\r\\nWinston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. Ju\\x02lia rolled sleepily against him, murmuring something \\r\\nthat might have been ‘What’s the matter?’\\r\\n‘I dreamt—’ he began, and stopped short. It was too com\\x02plex to be put into words. There was the dream itself, and \\r\\nthere was a memory connected with it that had swum into \\r\\nhis mind in the few seconds after waking.\\r\\nHe lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmo\\x02sphere of the dream. It was a vast, luminous dream in which \\r\\nhis whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a land\\x02scape on a summer evening after rain. It had all occurred \\r\\ninside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the glass \\r\\nwas the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything \\r\\nwas flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into \\r\\ninterminable distances. The dream had also been compre\\x02hended by—indeed, in some sense it had consisted in—a \\r\\ngesture of the arm made by his mother, and made again \\r\\nthirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on the \\r\\nnews film, trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, \\r\\nbefore the helicopter blew them both to pieces.\\r\\n‘Do you know,’ he said, ‘that until this moment I believed \\r\\nI had murdered my mother?’\\r\\n‘Why did you murder her?’ said Julia, almost asleep.\\r\\n‘I didn’t murder her. Not physically.’\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 203\\r\\nIn the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his \\r\\nmother, and within a few moments of waking the cluster \\r\\nof small events surrounding it had all come back. It was a \\r\\nmemory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his \\r\\nconsciousness over many years. He was not certain of the \\r\\ndate, but he could not have been less than ten years old, pos\\x02sibly twelve, when it had happened.\\r\\nHis father had disappeared some time earlier, how much \\r\\nearlier he could not remember. He remembered better the \\r\\nrackety, uneasy circumstances of the time: the periodical \\r\\npanics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tube stations, \\r\\nthe piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proc\\x02lamations posted at street corners, the gangs of youths in \\r\\nshirts all the same colour, the enormous queues outside \\r\\nthe bakeries, the intermittent machine-gun fire in the dis\\x02tance—above all, the fact that there was never enough to \\r\\neat. He remembered long afternoons spent with other boys \\r\\nin scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps, picking \\r\\nout the ribs of cabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimes \\r\\neven scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully \\r\\nscraped away the cinders; and also in waiting for the pass\\x02ing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were \\r\\nknown to carry cattle feed, and which, when they jolted \\r\\nover the bad patches in the road, sometimes spilt a few frag\\x02ments of oil-cake.\\r\\nWhen his father disappeared, his mother did not show \\r\\nany surprise or any violent grief, but a sudden change came \\r\\nover her. She seemed to have become completely spiritless. \\r\\nIt was evident even to Winston that she was waiting for \\n204 1984\\r\\nsomething that she knew must happen. She did everything \\r\\nthat was needed—cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, \\r\\nswept the floor, dusted the mantelpiece—always very slowly \\r\\nand with a curious lack of superfluous motion, like an art\\x02ist’s lay-figure moving of its own accord. Her large shapely \\r\\nbody seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. For hours \\r\\nat a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nurs\\x02ing his young sister, a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two \\r\\nor three, with a face made simian by thinness. Very occa\\x02sionally she would take Winston in her arms and press him \\r\\nagainst her for a long time without saying anything. He was \\r\\naware, in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness, that this \\r\\nwas somehow connected with the never-mentioned thing \\r\\nthat was about to happen.\\r\\nHe remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close\\x02smelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white \\r\\ncounterpane. There was a gas ring in the fender, and a shelf \\r\\nwhere food was kept, and on the landing outside there was \\r\\na brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. He \\r\\nremembered his mother’s statuesque body bending over the \\r\\ngas ring to stir at something in a saucepan. Above all he \\r\\nremembered his continuous hunger, and the fierce sordid \\r\\nbattles at mealtimes. He would ask his mother naggingly, \\r\\nover and over again, why there was not more food, he would \\r\\nshout and storm at her (he even remembered the tones of \\r\\nhis voice, which was beginning to break prematurely and \\r\\nsometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would attempt \\r\\na snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his \\r\\nshare. His mother was quite ready to give him more than \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 205\\r\\nhis share. She took it for granted that he, ‘the boy’, should \\r\\nhave the biggest portion; but however much she gave him \\r\\nhe invariably demanded more. At every meal she would be\\x02seech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little \\r\\nsister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. He \\r\\nwould cry out with rage when she stopped ladling, he would \\r\\ntry to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands, he \\r\\nwould grab bits from his sister’s plate. He knew that he was \\r\\nstarving the other two, but he could not help it; he even felt \\r\\nthat he had a right to do it. The clamorous hunger in his bel\\x02ly seemed to justify him. Between meals, if his mother did \\r\\nnot stand guard, he was constantly pilfering at the wretched \\r\\nstore of food on the shelf.\\r\\nOne day a chocolate-ration was issued. There had been \\r\\nno such issue for weeks or months past. He remembered \\r\\nquite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate. It was a \\r\\ntwo-ounce slab (they still talked about ounces in those days) \\r\\nbetween the three of them. It was obvious that it ought to \\r\\nbe divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he \\r\\nwere listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself \\r\\ndemanding in a loud booming voice that he should be giv\\x02en the whole piece. His mother told him not to be greedy. \\r\\nThere was a long, nagging argument that went round and \\r\\nround, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargain\\x02ings. His tiny sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, \\r\\nexactly like a baby monkey, sat looking over her shoulder at \\r\\nhim with large, mournful eyes. In the end his mother broke \\r\\noff three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to Winston, \\r\\ngiving the other quarter to his sister. The little girl took hold \\n206 1984\\r\\nof it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. \\r\\nWinston stood watching her for a moment. Then with a \\r\\nsudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate \\r\\nout of his sister’s hand and was fleeing for the door.\\r\\n‘Winston, Winston!’ his mother called after him. ‘Come \\r\\nback! Give your sister back her chocolate!’\\r\\nHe stopped, but did not come back. His mother’s anx\\x02ious eyes were fixed on his face. Even now he was thinking \\r\\nabout the thing, he did not know what it was that was on \\r\\nthe point of happening. His sister, conscious of having been \\r\\nrobbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. His mother \\r\\ndrew her arm round the child and pressed its face against \\r\\nher breast. Something in the gesture told him that his sis\\x02ter was dying. He turned and fled down the stairs, with the \\r\\nchocolate growing sticky in his hand.\\r\\nHe never saw his mother again. After he had devoured \\r\\nthe chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and \\r\\nhung about in the streets for several hours, until hunger \\r\\ndrove him home. When he came back his mother had dis\\x02appeared. This was already becoming normal at that time. \\r\\nNothing was gone from the room except his mother and his \\r\\nsister. They had not taken any clothes, not even his mother’s \\r\\novercoat. To this day he did not know with any certainty \\r\\nthat his mother was dead. It was perfectly possible that she \\r\\nhad merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for his \\r\\nsister, she might have been removed, like Winston himself, \\r\\nto one of the colonies for homeless children (Reclamation \\r\\nCentres, they were called) which had grown up as a result \\r\\nof the civil war, or she might have been sent to the labour \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 207\\r\\ncamp along with his mother, or simply left somewhere or \\r\\nother to die.\\r\\nThe dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the en\\x02veloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole \\r\\nmeaning seemed to be contained. His mind went back to \\r\\nanother dream of two months ago. Exactly as his mother \\r\\nhad sat on the dingy whitequilted bed, with the child cling\\x02ing to her, so she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath \\r\\nhim, and drowning deeper every minute, but still looking \\r\\nup at him through the darkening water.\\r\\nHe told Julia the story of his mother’s disappearance. \\r\\nWithout opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself \\r\\ninto a more comfortable position.\\r\\n‘I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,’ she \\r\\nsaid indistinctly. ‘All children are swine.’\\r\\n‘Yes. But the real point of the story——’\\r\\nFrom her breathing it was evident that she was going \\r\\noff to sleep again. He would have liked to continue talking \\r\\nabout his mother. He did not suppose, from what he could \\r\\nremember of her, that she had been an unusual woman, still \\r\\nless an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of \\r\\nnobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that \\r\\nshe obeyed were private ones. Her feelings were her own, \\r\\nand could not be altered from outside. It would not have \\r\\noccurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby \\r\\nbecomes meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved him, \\r\\nand when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him \\r\\nlove. When the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother \\r\\nhad clasped the child in her arms. It was no use, it changed \\n208 1984\\r\\nnothing, it did not produce more chocolate, it did not avert \\r\\nthe child’s death or her own; but it seemed natural to her to \\r\\ndo it. The refugee woman in the boat had also covered the \\r\\nlittle boy with her arm, which was no more use against the \\r\\nbullets than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Par\\x02ty had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere \\r\\nfeelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing \\r\\nyou of all power over the material world. When once you \\r\\nwere in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel, \\r\\nwhat you did or refrained from doing, made literally no dif\\x02ference. Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you \\r\\nnor your actions were ever heard of again. You were lifted \\r\\nclean out of the stream of history. And yet to the people \\r\\nof only two generations ago this would not have seemed \\r\\nall-important, because they were not attempting to alter \\r\\nhistory. They were governed by private loyalties which they \\r\\ndid not question. What mattered were individual relation\\x02ships, and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, \\r\\na word spoken to a dying man, could have value in itself. \\r\\nThe proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in \\r\\nthis condition. They were not loyal to a party or a country or \\r\\nan idea, they were loyal to one another. For the first time in \\r\\nhis life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely \\r\\nas an inert force which would one day spring to life and re\\x02generate the world. The proles had stayed human. They had \\r\\nnot become hardened inside. They had held on to the primi\\x02tive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious \\r\\neffort. And in thinking this he remembered, without appar\\x02ent relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 209\\r\\nhand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gut\\x02ter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk.\\r\\n‘The proles are human beings,’ he said aloud. ‘We are not \\r\\nhuman.’\\r\\n‘Why not?’ said Julia, who had woken up again.\\r\\nHe thought for a little while. ‘Has it ever occurred to you,’ \\r\\nhe said, ‘that the best thing for us to do would be simply to \\r\\nwalk out of here before it’s too late, and never see each other \\r\\nagain?’\\r\\n‘Yes, dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I’m \\r\\nnot going to do it, all the same.’\\r\\n‘We’ve been lucky,’ he said ‘but it can’t last much longer. \\r\\nYou’re young. You look normal and innocent. If you keep \\r\\nclear of people like me, you might stay alive for another fifty \\r\\nyears.’\\r\\n‘No. I’ve thought it all out. What you do, I’m going to do. \\r\\nAnd don’t be too downhearted. I’m rather good at staying \\r\\nalive.’\\r\\n‘We may be together for another six months—a year—\\r\\nthere’s no knowing. At the end we’re certain to be apart. Do \\r\\nyou realize how utterly alone we shall be? When once they \\r\\nget hold of us there will be nothing, literally nothing, that \\r\\neither of us can do for the other. If I confess, they’ll shoot \\r\\nyou, and if I refuse to confess, they’ll shoot you just the same. \\r\\nNothing that I can do or say, or stop myself from saying, will \\r\\nput off your death for as much as five minutes. Neither of us \\r\\nwill even know whether the other is alive or dead. We shall \\r\\nbe utterly without power of any kind. The one thing that \\r\\nmatters is that we shouldn’t betray one another, although \\n210 1984\\r\\neven that can’t make the slightest difference.’\\r\\n‘If you mean confessing,’ she said, ‘we shall do that, right \\r\\nenough. Everybody always confesses. You can’t help it. They \\r\\ntorture you.’\\r\\n‘I don’t mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. \\r\\nWhat you say or do doesn’t matter: only feelings matter. If \\r\\nthey could make me stop loving you—that would be the \\r\\nreal betrayal.’\\r\\nShe thought it over. ‘They can’t do that,’ she said final\\x02ly. ‘It’s the one thing they can’t do. They can make you say \\r\\nanything—ANYTHING—but they can’t make you believe \\r\\nit. They can’t get inside you.’\\r\\n‘No,’ he said a little more hopefully, ‘no; that’s quite true. \\r\\nThey can’t get inside you. If you can FEEL that staying hu\\x02man is worth while, even when it can’t have any result \\r\\nwhatever, you’ve beaten them.’\\r\\nHe thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear. \\r\\nThey could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your \\r\\nhead you could still outwit them. With all their cleverness \\r\\nthey had never mastered the secret of finding out what an\\x02other human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less true \\r\\nwhen you were actually in their hands. One did not know \\r\\nwhat happened inside the Ministry of Love, but it was pos\\x02sible to guess: tortures, drugs, delicate instruments that \\r\\nregistered your nervous reactions, gradual wearing-down \\r\\nby sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning. \\r\\nFacts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They could be \\r\\ntracked down by enquiry, they could be squeezed out of you \\r\\nby torture. But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 211\\r\\nhuman, what difference did it ultimately make? They could \\r\\nnot alter your feelings: for that matter you could not alter \\r\\nthem yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in \\r\\nthe utmost detail everything that you had done or said or \\r\\nthought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysteri\\x02ous even to yourself, remained impregnable.\\n212 1984\\r\\nChapter 8\\r\\nThey had done it, they had done it at last!\\r\\nThe room they were standing in was long-shaped and \\r\\nsoftly lit. The telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the \\r\\nrichness of the dark-blue carpet gave one the impression of \\r\\ntreading on velvet. At the far end of the room O’Brien was \\r\\nsitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of \\r\\npapers on either side of him. He had not bothered to look up \\r\\nwhen the servant showed Julia and Winston in.\\r\\nWinston’s heart was thumping so hard that he doubted \\r\\nwhether he would be able to speak. They had done it, they \\r\\nhad done it at last, was all he could think. It had been a rash \\r\\nact to come here at all, and sheer folly to arrive together; \\r\\nthough it was true that they had come by different routes \\r\\nand only met on O’Brien’s doorstep. But merely to walk into \\r\\nsuch a place needed an effort of the nerve. It was only on \\r\\nvery rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling-plac\\x02es of the Inner Party, or even penetrated into the quarter \\r\\nof the town where they lived. The whole atmosphere of the \\r\\nhuge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness of every\\x02thing, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco, \\r\\nthe silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the \\r\\nwhite-jacketed servants hurrying to and fro—everything \\r\\nwas intimidating. Although he had a good pretext for com\\x02ing here, he was haunted at every step by the fear that a \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 213\\r\\nblack-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round \\r\\nthe corner, demand his papers, and order him to get out. \\r\\nO’Brien’s servant, however, had admitted the two of them \\r\\nwithout demur. He was a small, dark-haired man in a white \\r\\njacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless \\r\\nface which might have been that of a Chinese. The passage \\r\\ndown which he led them was softly carpeted, with cream\\x02papered walls and white wainscoting, all exquisitely clean. \\r\\nThat too was intimidating. Winston could not remember \\r\\never to have seen a passageway whose walls were not grimy \\r\\nfrom the contact of human bodies.\\r\\nO’Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and \\r\\nseemed to be studying it intently. His heavy face, bent down \\r\\nso that one could see the line of the nose, looked both for\\x02midable and intelligent. For perhaps twenty seconds he sat \\r\\nwithout stirring. Then he pulled the speakwrite towards \\r\\nhim and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the \\r\\nMinistries:\\r\\n’Items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise \\r\\nstop suggestion contained item six doubleplus ridiculous \\r\\nverging crimethink cancel stop unproceed constructionwise \\r\\nantegetting plusfull estimates machinery overheads stop end \\r\\nmessage.’\\r\\nHe rose deliberately from his chair and came towards \\r\\nthem across the soundless carpet. A little of the official at\\x02mosphere seemed to have fallen away from him with the \\r\\nNewspeak words, but his expression was grimmer than \\n214 1984\\r\\nusual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. The \\r\\nterror that Winston already felt was suddenly shot through \\r\\nby a streak of ordinary embarrassment. It seemed to him \\r\\nquite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake. \\r\\nFor what evidence had he in reality that O’Brien was any \\r\\nkind of political conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyes \\r\\nand a single equivocal remark: beyond that, only his own \\r\\nsecret imaginings, founded on a dream. He could not even \\r\\nfall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the \\r\\ndictionary, because in that case Julia’s presence was impos\\x02sible to explain. As O’Brien passed the telescreen a thought \\r\\nseemed to strike him. He stopped, turned aside and pressed \\r\\na switch on the wall. There was a sharp snap. The voice had \\r\\nstopped.\\r\\nJulia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. \\r\\nEven in the midst of his panic, Winston was too much taken \\r\\naback to be able to hold his tongue.\\r\\n‘You can turn it off!’ he said.\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said O’Brien, ‘we can turn it off. We have that privi\\x02lege.’\\r\\nHe was opposite them now. His solid form towered \\r\\nover the pair of them, and the expression on his face was \\r\\nstill indecipherable. He was waiting, somewhat sternly, for \\r\\nWinston to speak, but about what? Even now it was quite \\r\\nconceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering ir\\x02ritably why he had been interrupted. Nobody spoke. After \\r\\nthe stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly si\\x02lent. The seconds marched past, enormous. With difficulty \\r\\nWinston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O’Brien’s. Then \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 215\\r\\nsuddenly the grim face broke down into what might have \\r\\nbeen the beginnings of a smile. With his characteristic ges\\x02ture O’Brien resettled his spectacles on his nose.\\r\\n‘Shall I say it, or will you?’ he said.\\r\\n‘I will say it,’ said Winston promptly. ‘That thing is really \\r\\nturned off?’\\r\\n‘Yes, everything is turned off. We are alone.’\\r\\n‘We have come here because——’\\r\\nHe paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of \\r\\nhis own motives. Since he did not in fact know what kind \\r\\nof help he expected from O’Brien, it was not easy to say why \\r\\nhe had come here. He went on, conscious that what he was \\r\\nsaying must sound both feeble and pretentious:\\r\\n‘We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy, some \\r\\nkind of secret organization working against the Party, and \\r\\nthat you are involved in it. We want to join it and work for it. \\r\\nWe are enemies of the Party. We disbelieve in the principles \\r\\nof Ingsoc. We are thought-criminals. We are also adulter\\x02ers. I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your \\r\\nmercy. If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other \\r\\nway, we are ready.’\\r\\nHe stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the \\r\\nfeeling that the door had opened. Sure enough, the little yel\\x02low-faced servant had come in without knocking. Winston \\r\\nsaw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses.\\r\\n‘Martin is one of us,’ said O’Brien impassively. ‘Bring \\r\\nthe drinks over here, Martin. Put them on the round table. \\r\\nHave we enough chairs? Then we may as well sit down and \\r\\ntalk in comfort. Bring a chair for yourself, Martin. This is \\n216 1984\\r\\nbusiness. You can stop being a servant for the next ten min\\x02utes.’\\r\\nThe little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still \\r\\nwith a servant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a priv\\x02ilege. Winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye. \\r\\nIt struck him that the man’s whole life was playing a part, \\r\\nand that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed per\\x02sonality even for a moment. O’Brien took the decanter by \\r\\nthe neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. It \\r\\naroused in Winston dim memories of something seen long \\r\\nago on a wall or a hoarding—a vast bottle composed of elec\\x02tric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its \\r\\ncontents into a glass. Seen from the top the stuff looked al\\x02most black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby. It had \\r\\na sour-sweet smell. He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff \\r\\nat it with frank curiosity.\\r\\n‘It is called wine,’ said O’Brien with a faint smile. ‘You \\r\\nwill have read about it in books, no doubt. Not much of it \\r\\ngets to the Outer Party, I am afraid.’ His face grew solemn \\r\\nagain, and he raised his glass: ‘I think it is fitting that we \\r\\nshould begin by drinking a health. To our Leader: To Em\\x02manuel Goldstein.’\\r\\nWinston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. Wine \\r\\nwas a thing he had read and dreamed about. Like the glass \\r\\npaperweight or Mr Charrington’s half-remembered rhymes, \\r\\nit belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the olden time \\r\\nas he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reason \\r\\nhe had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet \\r\\ntaste, like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxi-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 217\\r\\ncating effect. Actually, when he came to swallow it, the stuff \\r\\nwas distinctly disappointing. The truth was that after years \\r\\nof gin-drinking he could barely taste it. He set down the \\r\\nempty glass.\\r\\n‘Then there is such a person as Goldstein?’ he said.\\r\\n‘Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. Where, I do \\r\\nnot know.’\\r\\n‘And the conspiracy—the organization? Is it real? It is not \\r\\nsimply an invention of the Thought Police?’\\r\\n‘No, it is real. The Brotherhood, we call it. You will never \\r\\nlearn much more about the Brotherhood than that it exists \\r\\nand that you belong to it. I will come back to that pres\\x02ently.’ He looked at his wrist-watch. ‘It is unwise even for \\r\\nmembers of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for \\r\\nmore than half an hour. You ought not to have come here \\r\\ntogether, and you will have to leave separately. You, com\\x02rade’—he bowed his head to Julia—’will leave first. We have \\r\\nabout twenty minutes at our disposal. You will understand \\r\\nthat I must start by asking you certain questions. In general \\r\\nterms, what are you prepared to do?’\\r\\n‘Anything that we are capable of,’ said Winston.\\r\\nO’Brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he \\r\\nwas facing Winston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming to \\r\\ntake it for granted that Winston could speak for her. For a \\r\\nmoment the lids flitted down over his eyes. He began asking \\r\\nhis questions in a low, expressionless voice, as though this \\r\\nwere a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers \\r\\nwere known to him already.\\r\\n‘You are prepared to give your lives?’\\n218 1984\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘You are prepared to commit murder?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death \\r\\nof hundreds of innocent people?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘To betray your country to foreign powers?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘You are prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to cor\\x02rupt the minds of children, to distribute habit-forming \\r\\ndrugs, to encourage prostitution, to disseminate venereal \\r\\ndiseases—to do anything which is likely to cause demoral\\x02ization and weaken the power of the Party?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘If, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to \\r\\nthrow sulphuric acid in a child’s face—are you prepared to \\r\\ndo that?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘You are prepared to lose your identity and live out the \\r\\nrest of your life as a waiter or a dock-worker?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘You are prepared to commit suicide, if and when we or\\x02der you to do so?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘You are prepared, the two of you, to separate and never \\r\\nsee one another again?’\\r\\n‘No!’ broke in Julia.\\r\\nIt appeared to Winston that a long time passed before \\r\\nhe answered. For a moment he seemed even to have been \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 219\\r\\ndeprived of the power of speech. His tongue worked sound\\x02lessly, forming the opening syllables first of one word, then \\r\\nof the other, over and over again. Until he had said it, he \\r\\ndid not know which word he was going to say. ‘No,’ he said \\r\\nfinally.\\r\\n‘You did well to tell me,’ said O’Brien. ‘It is necessary for \\r\\nus to know everything.’\\r\\nHe turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice \\r\\nwith somewhat more expression in it:\\r\\n‘Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be \\r\\nas a different person? We may be obliged to give him a new \\r\\nidentity. His face, his movements, the shape of his hands, \\r\\nthe colour of his hair—even his voice would be different. \\r\\nAnd you yourself might have become a different person. \\r\\nOur surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. Some\\x02times it is necessary. Sometimes we even amputate a limb.’\\r\\nWinston could not help snatching another sidelong \\r\\nglance at Martin’s Mongolian face. There were no scars \\r\\nthat he could see. Julia had turned a shade paler, so that \\r\\nher freckles were showing, but she faced O’Brien boldly. She \\r\\nmurmured something that seemed to be assent.\\r\\n‘Good. Then that is settled.’\\r\\nThere was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a \\r\\nrather absent-minded air O’Brien pushed them towards the \\r\\nothers, took one himself, then stood up and began to pace \\r\\nslowly to and fro, as though he could think better standing. \\r\\nThey were very good cigarettes, very thick and well-packed, \\r\\nwith an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. O’Brien looked at \\r\\nhis wrist-watch again.\\n220 1984\\r\\n‘You had better go back to your Pantry, Martin,’ he said. \\r\\n‘I shall switch on in a quarter of an hour. Take a good look \\r\\nat these comrades’ faces before you go. You will be seeing \\r\\nthem again. I may not.’\\r\\nExactly as they had done at the front door, the little man’s \\r\\ndark eyes flickered over their faces. There was not a trace \\r\\nof friendliness in his manner. He was memorizing their \\r\\nappearance, but he felt no interest in them, or appeared \\r\\nto feel none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic face \\r\\nwas perhaps incapable of changing its expression. Without \\r\\nspeaking or giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out, \\r\\nclosing the door silently behind him. O’Brien was strolling \\r\\nup and down, one hand in the pocket of his black overalls, \\r\\nthe other holding his cigarette.\\r\\n‘You understand,’ he said, ‘that you will be fighting in \\r\\nthe dark. You will always be in the dark. You will receive \\r\\norders and you will obey them, without knowing why. Later \\r\\nI shall send you a book from which you will learn the true \\r\\nnature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which \\r\\nwe shall destroy it. When you have read the book, you will \\r\\nbe full members of the Brotherhood. But between the gen\\x02eral aims that we are fighting for and the immedi ate tasks \\r\\nof the moment, you will never know anything. I tell you \\r\\nthat the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you wheth\\x02er it numbers a hundred members, or ten million. From \\r\\nyour personal knowledge you will never be able to say that \\r\\nit numbers even as many as a dozen. You will have three \\r\\nor four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time \\r\\nas they disappear. As this was your first contact, it will be \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 221\\r\\npreserved. When you receive orders, they will come from \\r\\nme. If we find it necessary to communicate with you, it will \\r\\nbe through Martin. When you are finally caught, you will \\r\\nconfess. That is unavoidable. But you will have very little \\r\\nto confess, other than your own actions. You will not be \\r\\nable to betray more than a handful of unimportant people. \\r\\nProbably you will not even betray me. By that time I may be \\r\\ndead, or I shall have become a different person, with a dif\\x02ferent face.’\\r\\nHe continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. In \\r\\nspite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable \\r\\ngrace in his movements. It came out even in the gesture \\r\\nwith which he thrust a hand into his pocket, or manipu\\x02lated a cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave an \\r\\nimpression of confidence and of an understanding tinged \\r\\nby irony. However much in earnest he might be, he had \\r\\nnothing of the single-mindedness that belongs to a fanatic. \\r\\nWhen he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease, am\\x02putated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air of \\r\\npersiflage. ‘This is unavoidable,’ his voice seemed to say; \\r\\n‘this is what we have got to do, unflinchingly. But this is \\r\\nnot what we shall be doing when life is worth living again.’ \\r\\nA wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out from \\r\\nWinston towards O’Brien. For the moment he had forgot\\x02ten the shadowy figure of Goldstein. When you looked at \\r\\nO’Brien’s powerful shoulders and his blunt-featured face, so \\r\\nugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible to believe that \\r\\nhe could be defeated. There was no stratagem that he was \\r\\nnot equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia \\n222 1984\\r\\nseemed to be impressed. She had let her cigarette go out and \\r\\nwas listening intently. O’Brien went on:\\r\\n‘You will have heard rumours of the existence of the \\r\\nBrotherhood. No doubt you have formed your own picture \\r\\nof it. You have imagined, probably, a huge underworld of \\r\\nconspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling mes\\x02sages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by \\r\\nspecial movements of the hand. Nothing of the kind exists. \\r\\nThe members of the Brotherhood have no way of recogniz\\x02ing one another, and it is impossible for any one member to \\r\\nbe aware of the identity of more than a few others. Gold\\x02stein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police, \\r\\ncould not give them a complete list of members, or any in\\x02formation that would lead them to a complete list. No such \\r\\nlist exists. The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it \\r\\nis not an organization in the ordinary sense. Nothing holds \\r\\nit together except an idea which is indestructible. You will \\r\\nnever have anything to sustain you, except the idea. You \\r\\nwill get no comradeship and no encouragement. When fi\\x02nally you are caught, you will get no help. We never help \\r\\nour members. At most, when it is absolutely necessary that \\r\\nsomeone should be silenced, we are occasionally able to \\r\\nsmuggle a razor blade into a prisoner’s cell. You will have \\r\\nto get used to living without results and without hope. You \\r\\nwill work for a while, you will be caught, you will confess, \\r\\nand then you will die. Those are the only results that you \\r\\nwill ever see. There is no possibility that any perceptible \\r\\nchange will happen within our own lifetime. We are the \\r\\ndead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 223\\r\\nin it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. But how far \\r\\naway that future may be, there is no knowing. It might be \\r\\na thousand years. At present nothing is possible except to \\r\\nextend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act col\\x02lectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards from \\r\\nindividual to individual, generation after generation. In the \\r\\nface of the Thought Police there is no other way.’\\r\\nHe halted and looked for the third time at his wrist\\x02watch.\\r\\n‘It is almost time for you to leave, comrade,’ he said to Ju\\x02lia. ‘Wait. The decanter is still half full.’\\r\\nHe filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the \\r\\nstem.\\r\\n‘What shall it be this time?’ he said, still with the same \\r\\nfaint suggestion of irony. ‘To the confusion of the Thought \\r\\nPolice? To the death of Big Brother? To humanity? To the \\r\\nfuture?’\\r\\n‘To the past,’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘The past is more important,’ agreed O’Brien gravely.\\r\\nThey emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia \\r\\nstood up to go. O’Brien took a small box from the top of a \\r\\ncabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told her \\r\\nto place on her tongue. It was important, he said, not to go \\r\\nout smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very obser\\x02vant. As soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared \\r\\nto forget her existence. He took another pace or two up and \\r\\ndown, then stopped.\\r\\n‘There are details to be settled,’ he said. ‘I assume that \\r\\nyou have a hiding-place of some kind?’\\n224 1984\\r\\nWinston explained about the room over Mr Char\\x02rington’s shop.\\r\\n‘That will do for the moment. Later we will arrange \\r\\nsomething else for you. It is important to change one’s hid\\x02ing-place frequently. Meanwhile I shall send you a copy of \\r\\nTHE BOOK’—even O’Brien, Winston noticed, seemed to \\r\\npronounce the words as though they were in italics—’Gold\\x02stein’s book, you understand, as soon as possible. It may \\r\\nbe some days before I can get hold of one. There are not \\r\\nmany in existence, as you can imagine. The Thought Police \\r\\nhunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can \\r\\nproduce them. It makes very little difference. The book is \\r\\nindestructible. If the last copy were gone, we could repro\\x02duce it almost word for word. Do you carry a brief-case to \\r\\nwork with you?’ he added.\\r\\n‘As a rule, yes.’\\r\\n‘What is it like?’\\r\\n‘Black, very shabby. With two straps.’\\r\\n‘Black, two straps, very shabby—good. One day in the \\r\\nfairly near future—I cannot give a date—one of the messag\\x02es among your morning’s work will contain a misprinted \\r\\nword, and you will have to ask for a repeat. On the following \\r\\nday you will go to work without your brief-case. At some \\r\\ntime during the day, in the street, a man will touch you on \\r\\nthe arm and say ‘I think you have dropped your brief-case.’ \\r\\nThe one he gives you will contain a copy of Goldstein’s book. \\r\\nYou will return it within fourteen days.’\\r\\nThey were silent for a moment.\\r\\n‘There are a couple of minutes before you need go,’ said \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 225\\r\\nO’Brien. ‘We shall meet again—if we do meet again——’\\r\\nWinston looked up at him. ‘In the place where there is no \\r\\ndarkness?’ he said hesitantly.\\r\\nO’Brien nodded without appearance of surprise. ‘In the \\r\\nplace where there is no darkness,’ he said, as though he had \\r\\nrecognized the allusion. ‘And in the meantime, is there any\\x02thing that you wish to say before you leave? Any message? \\r\\nAny question?.’\\r\\nWinston thought. There did not seem to be any further \\r\\nquestion that he wanted to ask: still less did he feel any \\r\\nimpulse to utter high-sounding generalities. Instead of any\\x02thing directly connected with O’Brien or the Brotherhood, \\r\\nthere came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the \\r\\ndark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, \\r\\nand the little room over Mr Charrington’s shop, and the \\r\\nglass paperweight, and the steel engraving in its rosewood \\r\\nframe. Almost at random he said:\\r\\n‘Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins \\r\\n‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s’?’\\r\\nAgain O’Brien nodded. With a sort of grave courtesy he \\r\\ncompleted the stanza:\\r\\n’Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s, \\r\\nYou owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin’s, \\r\\nWhen will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey, \\r\\nWhen I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch.’\\r\\n‘You knew the last line!’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘Yes, I knew the last line. And now, I am afraid, it is time \\n226 1984\\r\\nfor you to go. But wait. You had better let me give you one \\r\\nof these tablets.’\\r\\nAs Winston stood up O’Brien held out a hand. His pow\\x02erful grip crushed the bones of Winston’s palm. At the \\r\\ndoor Winston looked back, but O’Brien seemed already to \\r\\nbe in process of putting him out of mind. He was waiting \\r\\nwith his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen. \\r\\nBeyond him Winston could see the writing-table with its \\r\\ngreen-shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets \\r\\ndeep-laden with papers. The incident was closed. Within \\r\\nthirty seconds, it occurred to him, O’Brien would be back at \\r\\nhis interrupted and important work on behalf of the Party.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 227\\r\\nChapter 9\\r\\nWinston was gelatinous with fatigue. Gelatinous was \\r\\nthe right word. It had come into his head spontane\\x02ously. His body seemed to have not only the weakness of a \\r\\njelly, but its translucency. He felt that if he held up his hand \\r\\nhe would be able to see the light through it. All the blood \\r\\nand lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous \\r\\ndebauch of work, leaving only a frail structure of nerves, \\r\\nbones, and skin. All sensations seemed to be magnified. His \\r\\noveralls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled his feet, \\r\\neven the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that \\r\\nmade his joints creak.\\r\\nHe had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So \\r\\nhad everyone else in the Ministry. Now it was all over, and \\r\\nhe had literally nothing to do, no Party work of any descrip\\x02tion, until tomorrow morning. He could spend six hours in \\r\\nthe hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, in \\r\\nmild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the \\r\\ndirection of Mr Charrington’s shop, keeping one eye open \\r\\nfor the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this after\\x02noon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him. \\r\\nThe heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumped against \\r\\nhis knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and \\r\\ndown the skin of his leg. Inside it was the book, which he \\r\\nhad now had in his possession for six days and had not yet \\n228 1984\\r\\nopened, nor even looked at.\\r\\nOn the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the \\r\\nspeeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, \\r\\nthe films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squeal\\x02ing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the grinding \\r\\nof the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the \\r\\nbooming of guns—after six days of this, when the great or\\x02gasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of \\r\\nEurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd \\r\\ncould have got their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-crim\\x02inals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the \\r\\nproceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them \\r\\nto pieces—at just this moment it had been announced that \\r\\nOceania was not after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was \\r\\nat war with Eastasia. Eurasia was an ally.\\r\\nThere was, of course, no admission that any change had \\r\\ntaken place. Merely it became known, with extreme sud\\x02denness and everywhere at once, that Eastasia and not \\r\\nEurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a dem\\x02onstration in one of the central London squares at the \\r\\nmoment when it happened. It was night, and the white fac\\x02es and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit. The square \\r\\nwas packed with several thousand people, including a block \\r\\nof about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the \\r\\nSpies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the Inner \\r\\nParty, a small lean man with disproportionately long arms \\r\\nand a large bald skull over which a few lank locks strag\\x02gled, was haranguing the crowd. A little Rumpelstiltskin \\r\\nfigure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 229\\r\\nmicrophone with one hand while the other, enormous at \\r\\nthe end of a bony arm, clawed the air menacingly above his \\r\\nhead. His voice, made metallic by the amplifiers, boomed \\r\\nforth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres, depor\\x02tations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing \\r\\nof civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken \\r\\ntreaties. It was almost impossible to listen to him without \\r\\nbeing first convinced and then maddened. At every few mo\\x02ments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the \\r\\nspeaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose \\r\\nuncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most sav\\x02age yells of all came from the schoolchildren. The speech \\r\\nhad been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a \\r\\nmessenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper \\r\\nwas slipped into the speaker’s hand. He unrolled and read it \\r\\nwithout pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice \\r\\nor manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but sud\\x02denly the names were different. Without words said, a wave \\r\\nof understanding rippled through the crowd. Oceania was \\r\\nat war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremen\\x02dous commotion. The banners and posters with which the \\r\\nsquare was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of them \\r\\nhad the wrong faces on them. It was sabotage! The agents of \\r\\nGoldstein had been at work! There was a riotous interlude \\r\\nwhile posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to \\r\\nshreds and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prod\\x02igies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting \\r\\nthe streamers that fluttered from the chimneys. But within \\r\\ntwo or three minutes it was all over. The orator, still gripping \\n230 1984\\r\\nthe neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward, \\r\\nhis free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with \\r\\nhis speech. One minute more, and the feral roars of rage \\r\\nwere again bursting from the crowd. The Hate continued \\r\\nexactly as before, except that the target had been changed.\\r\\nThe thing that impressed Winston in looking back was \\r\\nthat the speaker had switched from one line to the other ac\\x02tually in midsentence, not only without a pause, but without \\r\\neven breaking the syntax. But at the moment he had other \\r\\nthings to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of dis\\x02order while the posters were being torn down that a man \\r\\nwhose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder \\r\\nand said, ‘Excuse me, I think you’ve dropped your brief\\x02case.’ He took the brief-case abstractedly, without speaking. \\r\\nHe knew that it would be days before he had an opportuni\\x02ty to look inside it. The instant that the demonstration was \\r\\nover he went straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the \\r\\ntime was now nearly twenty-three hours. The entire staff \\r\\nof the Ministry had done likewise. The orders already issu\\x02ing from the telescreen, recalling them to their posts, were \\r\\nhardly necessary.\\r\\nOceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always \\r\\nbeen at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political lit\\x02erature of five years was now completely obsolete. Reports \\r\\nand records of all kinds, newspapers, books, pamphlets, \\r\\nfilms, sound-tracks, photographs—all had to be rectified \\r\\nat lightning speed. Although no directive was ever issued, \\r\\nit was known that the chiefs of the Department intended \\r\\nthat within one week no reference to the war with Eurasia, \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 231\\r\\nor the alliance with Eastasia, should remain in existence \\r\\nanywhere. The work was overwhelming, all the more so \\r\\nbecause the processes that it involved could not be called \\r\\nby their true names. Everyone in the Records Department \\r\\nworked eighteen hours in the twenty-four, with two three\\x02hour snatches of sleep. Mattresses were brought up from \\r\\nthe cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals con\\x02sisted of sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round \\r\\non trolleys by attendants from the canteen. Each time that \\r\\nWinston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to \\r\\nleave his desk clear of work, and each time that he crawled \\r\\nback sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that another \\r\\nshower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snow\\x02drift, halfburying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the \\r\\nfloor, so that the first job was always to stack them into a \\r\\nneat enough pile to give him room to work. What was worst \\r\\nof all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical. \\r\\nOften it was enough merely to substitute one name for an\\x02other, but any detailed report of events demanded care and \\r\\nimagination. Even the geographical knowledge that one \\r\\nneeded in transferring the war from one part of the world \\r\\nto another was considerable.\\r\\nBy the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his \\r\\nspectacles needed wiping every few minutes. It was like \\r\\nstruggling with some crushing physical task, something \\r\\nwhich one had the right to refuse and which one was never\\x02theless neurotically anxious to accomplish. In so far as he \\r\\nhad time to remember it, he was not troubled by the fact that \\r\\nevery word he murmured into the speakwrite, every stroke \\n232 1984\\r\\nof his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie. He was as anxious as \\r\\nanyone else in the Department that the forgery should be \\r\\nperfect. On the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cyl\\x02inders slowed down. For as much as half an hour nothing \\r\\ncame out of the tube; then one more cylinder, then nothing. \\r\\nEverywhere at about the same time the work was easing off. \\r\\nA deep and as it were secret sigh went through the Depart\\x02ment. A mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, had \\r\\nbeen achieved. It was now impossible for any human being \\r\\nto prove by documentary evidence that the war with Eurasia \\r\\nhad ever happened. At twelve hundred it was unexpectedly \\r\\nannounced that all workers in the Ministry were free till \\r\\ntomorrow morning. Winston, still carrying the brief-case \\r\\ncontaining the book, which had remained between his feet \\r\\nwhile he worked and under his body while he slept, went \\r\\nhome, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep in his bath, al\\x02though the water was barely more than tepid.\\r\\nWith a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he \\r\\nclimbed the stair above Mr Charrington’s shop. He was \\r\\ntired, but not sleepy any longer. He opened the window, lit \\r\\nthe dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee. \\r\\nJulia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book. \\r\\nHe sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps \\r\\nof the brief-case.\\r\\nA heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no \\r\\nname or title on the cover. The print also looked slightly \\r\\nirregular. The pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart, \\r\\neasily, as though the book had passed through many hands. \\r\\nThe inscription on the title-page ran:\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 233\\r\\nTHE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF \\r\\nOLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM \\r\\nby \\r\\nEmmanuel Goldstein\\r\\nWinston began reading:\\r\\nChapter I \\r\\nIgnorance is Strength\\r\\nThroughout recorded time, and probably since the end \\r\\nof the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people \\r\\nin the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have \\r\\nbeen subdivided in many ways, they have borne count\\x02less different names, and their relative numbers, as well as \\r\\ntheir attitude towards one another, have varied from age to \\r\\nage: but the essential structure of society has never altered. \\r\\nEven after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable \\r\\nchanges, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just \\r\\nas a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however \\r\\nfar it is pushed one way or the other.\\r\\nThe aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable...\\r\\nWinston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciate \\r\\nthe fact that he was reading, in comfort and safety. He was \\r\\nalone: no telescreen, no ear at the keyhole, no nervous im\\x02pulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his \\r\\nhand. The sweet summer air played against his cheek. From \\r\\nsomewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of chil-\\n234 1984\\r\\ndren: in the room itself there was no sound except the insect \\r\\nvoice of the clock. He settled deeper into the arm-chair and \\r\\nput his feet up on the fender. It was bliss, it was etemity. \\r\\nSuddenly, as one sometimes does with a book of which one \\r\\nknows that one will ultimately read and re-read every word, \\r\\nhe opened it at a different place and found himself at Chap\\x02ter III. He went on reading:\\r\\nChapter III \\r\\nWar is Peace\\r\\nThe splitting up of the world into three great super-states \\r\\nwas an event which could be and indeed was foreseen \\r\\nbefore the middle of the twentieth century. With the ab\\x02sorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire by \\r\\nthe United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia \\r\\nand Oceania, were already effectively in being. The third, \\r\\nEastasia, only emerged as a distinct unit after another de\\x02cade of confused fighting. The frontiers between the three \\r\\nsuper-states are in some places arbitrary, and in others they \\r\\nfluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general \\r\\nthey follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the whole \\r\\nof the northern part of the European and Asiatic land-mass, \\r\\nfrom Portugal to the Bering Strait. Oceania comprises the \\r\\nAmericas, the Atlantic islands including the British Isles, \\r\\nAustralasia, and the southern portion of Africa. Eastasia, \\r\\nsmaller than the others and with a less definite western \\r\\nfrontier, comprises China and the countries to the south of \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 235\\r\\nit, the Japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion \\r\\nof Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.\\r\\nIn one combination or another, these three super-states \\r\\nare permanently at war, and have been so for the past twen\\x02ty-five years. War, however, is no longer the desperate, \\r\\nannihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the \\r\\ntwentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims between \\r\\ncombatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no \\r\\nmaterial cause for fighting and are not divided by any genu\\x02ine ideological difference This is not to say that either the \\r\\nconduct of war, or the prevailing attitude towards it, has be\\x02come less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous. On the contrary, \\r\\nwar hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries, \\r\\nand such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, \\r\\nthe reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals \\r\\nagainst prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying \\r\\nalive, are looked upon as normal, and, when they are com\\x02mitted by one’s own side and not by the enemy, meritorious. \\r\\nBut in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of \\r\\npeople, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes com\\x02paratively few casualties. The fighting, when there is any, \\r\\ntakes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the \\r\\naverage man can only guess at, or round the Floating For\\x02tresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In the \\r\\ncentres of civilization war means no more than a contin\\x02uous shortage of consumption goods, and the occasional \\r\\ncrash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of \\r\\ndeaths. War has in fact changed its character. More exactly, \\r\\nthe reasons for which war is waged have changed in their \\n236 1984\\r\\norder of importance. Motives which were already present \\r\\nto some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth \\r\\ncentuury have now become dominant and are consciously \\r\\nrecognized and acted upon.\\r\\nTo understand the nature of the present war—for in spite \\r\\nof the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is al\\x02ways the same war—one must realize in the first place that \\r\\nit is impossible for it to be decisive. None of the three su\\x02per-states could be definitively conquered even by the other \\r\\ntwo in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their \\r\\nnatural defences are too formidable. Eurasia is protected by \\r\\nits vast land spaces, Oceania by the width of the Atlantic \\r\\nand the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity and indus tri\\x02ousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in \\r\\na material sense, anything to fight about. With the estab\\x02lishment of self-contained economies, in which production \\r\\nand consumption are geared to one another, the scramble \\r\\nfor markets which was a main cause of previous wars has \\r\\ncome to an end, while the competition for raw materials is \\r\\nno longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the \\r\\nthree super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the \\r\\nmaterials that it needs within its own boundaries. In so far \\r\\nas the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for la\\x02bour power. Between the frontiers of the super-states, and \\r\\nnot permanently in the possession of any of them, there lies \\r\\na rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazza\\x02ville, Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about \\r\\na fifth of the population of the earth. It is for the posses\\x02sion of these thickly-populated regions, and of the northern \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 237\\r\\nice-cap, that the three powers are constantly struggling. In \\r\\npractice no one power ever controls the whole of the disput\\x02ed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and \\r\\nit is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sud\\x02den stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of \\r\\nalignment.\\r\\nAll of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, \\r\\nand some of them yield important vegetable products such \\r\\nas rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to syn\\x02thesize by comparatively expensive methods. But above all \\r\\nthey contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Which\\x02ever power controls equatorial Africa, or the countries \\r\\nof the Middle East, or Southern India, or the Indonesian \\r\\nArchipelago, disposes also of the bodies of scores or hun\\x02dreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies. The \\r\\ninhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to \\r\\nthe status of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to con\\x02queror, and are expended like so much coal or oil in the \\r\\nrace to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, \\r\\nto control more labour power, to turn out more armaments, \\r\\nto capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It should \\r\\nbe noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the \\r\\nedges of the disputed areas. The frontiers of Eurasia flow \\r\\nback and forth between the basin of the Congo and the \\r\\nnorthern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the In\\x02dian Ocean and the Pacific are constantly being captured \\r\\nand recaptured by Oceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia the \\r\\ndividing line between Eurasia and Eastasia is never stable; \\r\\nround the Pole all three powers lay claim to enormous terri-\\n238 1984\\r\\ntories which in fact are largely unihabited and unexplored: \\r\\nbut the balance of power always remains roughly even, and \\r\\nthe territory which forms the heartland of each super-state \\r\\nalways remains inviolate. Moreover, the labour of the ex\\x02ploited peoples round the Equator is not really necessary to \\r\\nthe world’s economy. They add nothing to the wealth of the \\r\\nworld, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of \\r\\nwar, and the object of waging a war is always to be in a bet\\x02ter position in which to wage another war. By their labour \\r\\nthe slave populations allow the tempo of continuous war\\x02fare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist, the structure \\r\\nof world society, and the process by which it maintains it\\x02self, would not be essentially different.\\r\\nThe primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance \\r\\nwith the principles of DOUBLETHINK, this aim is simul\\x02taneously recognized and not recognized by the directing \\r\\nbrains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the \\r\\nmachine without raising the general standard of living. \\r\\nEver since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of \\r\\nwhat to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been \\r\\nlatent in industrial society. At present, when few human be\\x02ings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not \\r\\nurgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artifi\\x02cial processes of destruction had been at work. The world \\r\\nof today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with \\r\\nthe world that existed before 1914, and still more so if com\\x02pared with the imaginary future to which the people of that \\r\\nperiod looked forward. In the early twentieth century, the \\r\\nvision of a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 239\\r\\nand efficient—a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel \\r\\nand snow-white concrete—was part of the consciousness of \\r\\nnearly every literate person. Science and technology were \\r\\ndeveloping at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to \\r\\nassume that they would go on developing. This failed to \\r\\nhappen, partly because of the impoverishment caused by a \\r\\nlong series of wars and revolutions, partly because scientific \\r\\nand technical progress depended on the empirical habit of \\r\\nthought, which could not survive in a strictly regimented \\r\\nsociety. As a whole the world is more primitive today than it \\r\\nwas fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced, \\r\\nand various devices, always in some way connected with \\r\\nwarfare and police espionage, have been developed, but \\r\\nexperiment and invention have largely stopped, and the \\r\\nravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have nev\\x02er been fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent \\r\\nin the machine are still there. From the moment when the \\r\\nmachine first made its appearance it was clear to all think\\x02ing people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore \\r\\nto a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If \\r\\nthe machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, \\r\\noverwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated \\r\\nwithin a few generations. And in fact, without being used \\r\\nfor any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process—\\r\\nby producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not \\r\\nto distribute—the machine did raise the living standards \\r\\nof the average humand being very greatly over a period of \\r\\nabout fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the begin\\x02ning of the twentieth centuries.\\n240 1984\\r\\nBut it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth \\r\\nthreatened the destruction—indeed, in some sense was the \\r\\ndestruction—of a hierarchical society. In a world in which \\r\\neveryone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a \\r\\nhouse with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a \\r\\nmotor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and per\\x02haps the most important form of inequality would already \\r\\nhave disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would \\r\\nconfer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine \\r\\na society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personal pos\\x02sessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while \\r\\nPOWER remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. \\r\\nBut in practice such a society could not long remain sta\\x02ble. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the \\r\\ngreat mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by \\r\\npoverty would become literate and would learn to think for \\r\\nthemselves; and when once they had done this, they would \\r\\nsooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no \\r\\nfunction, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, \\r\\na hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of pov\\x02erty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as \\r\\nsome thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth cen\\x02tury dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It \\r\\nconflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which \\r\\nhad become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole \\r\\nworld, and moreover, any country which remained indus\\x02trially backward was helpless in a military sense and was \\r\\nbound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more \\r\\nadvanced rivals.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 241\\r\\nNor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in \\r\\npoverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened \\r\\nto a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, rough\\x02ly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries \\r\\nwas allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital \\r\\nequipment was not added to, great blocks of the popula\\x02tion were prevented from working and kept half alive by \\r\\nState charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and \\r\\nsince the privations it inflicted were obviously unneces\\x02sary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how \\r\\nto keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing \\r\\nthe real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but \\r\\nthey must not be distributed. And in practice the only way \\r\\nof achieving this was by continuous warfare.\\r\\nThe essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of \\r\\nhuman lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a \\r\\nway of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, \\r\\nor sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might \\r\\notherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and \\r\\nhence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons \\r\\nof war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still \\r\\na convenient way of expending labour power without pro\\x02ducing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, \\r\\nfor example, has locked up in it the labour that would build \\r\\nseveral hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as \\r\\nobsolete, never having brought any material benefit to any\\x02body, and with further enormous labours another Floating \\r\\nFortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so \\r\\nplanned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meet-\\n242 1984\\r\\ning the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs \\r\\nof the population are always underestimated, with the re\\x02sult that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities \\r\\nof life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate \\r\\npolicy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near \\r\\nthe brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity \\r\\nincreases the importance of small privileges and thus mag\\x02nifies the distinction between one group and another. By \\r\\nthe standards of the early twentieth century, even a mem\\x02ber of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. \\r\\nNevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, \\r\\nwell-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the bet\\x02ter quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or \\r\\nthree servants, his private motor-car or helicopter—set him \\r\\nin a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and \\r\\nthe members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage \\r\\nin comparison with the submerged masses whom we call \\r\\n‘the proles’. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, \\r\\nwhere the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the dif\\x02ference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time \\r\\nthe consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, \\r\\nmakes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem \\r\\nthe natural, unavoidable condition of survival.\\r\\nWar, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruc\\x02tion, but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. \\r\\nIn principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus \\r\\nlabour of the world by building temples and pyramids, by \\r\\ndigging holes and filling them up again, or even by produc\\x02ing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 243\\r\\nBut this would provide only the economic and not the emo\\x02tional basis for a hierarchical society. What is concerned \\r\\nhere is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unim\\x02portant so long as they are kept steadily at work, but the \\r\\nmorale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member \\r\\nis expected to be competent, industrious, and even intel\\x02ligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he \\r\\nshould be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing \\r\\nmoods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph. In \\r\\nother words it is necessary that he should have the mental\\x02ity appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether \\r\\nthe war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory \\r\\nis possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well \\r\\nor badly. All that is needed is that a state of war should ex\\x02ist. The splitting of the intelligence which the Party requires \\r\\nof its members, and which is more easily achieved in an at\\x02mosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher \\r\\nup the ranks one goes, the more marked it becomes. It is \\r\\nprecisely in the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred of \\r\\nthe enemy are strongest. In his capacity as an administra\\x02tor, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party to \\r\\nknow that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and \\r\\nhe may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is \\r\\neither not happening or is being waged for purposes quite \\r\\nother than the declared ones: but such knowledge is easily \\r\\nneutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK. Mean\\x02while no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his \\r\\nmystical belief that the war is real, and that it is bound to \\r\\nend victoriously, with Oceania the undisputed master of \\n244 1984\\r\\nthe entire world.\\r\\nAll members of the Inner Party believe in this coming \\r\\nconquest as an article of faith. It is to be achieved either by \\r\\ngradually acquiring more and more territory and so build\\x02ing up an overwhelming preponderance of power, or by \\r\\nthe discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The \\r\\nsearch for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one \\r\\nof the very few remaining activities in which the inventive \\r\\nor speculative type of mind can find any outlet. In Ocea\\x02nia at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost \\r\\nceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for ‘Science’. \\r\\nThe empirical method of thought, on which all the scien\\x02tific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to \\r\\nthe most fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And even tech\\x02nological progress only happens when its products can in \\r\\nsome way be used for the diminution of human liberty. In \\r\\nall the useful arts the world is either standing still or go\\x02ing backwards. The fields are cultivated with horse-ploughs \\r\\nwhile books are written by machinery. But in matters of \\r\\nvital importance—meaning, in effect, war and police espio\\x02nage—the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least \\r\\ntolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole \\r\\nsurface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the \\r\\npossibility of independent thought. There are therefore two \\r\\ngreat problems which the Party is concerned to solve. One \\r\\nis how to discover, against his will, what another human be\\x02ing is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred \\r\\nmillion people in a few seconds without giving warning be\\x02forehand. In so far as scientific research still continues, this \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 245\\r\\nis its subject matter. The scientist of today is either a mixture \\r\\nof psychologist and inquisitor, studying with real ordinary \\r\\nminuteness the meaning of facial expressions, gestures, and \\r\\ntones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of \\r\\ndrugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he \\r\\nis chemist, physicist, or biologist concerned only with such \\r\\nbranches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking \\r\\nof life. In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of Peace, and \\r\\nin the experimental stations hidden in the Brazilian forests, \\r\\nor in the Australian desert, or on lost islands of the Ant\\x02arctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some \\r\\nare concerned simply with planning the logistics of future \\r\\nwars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs, more \\r\\nand more powerful explosives, and more and more impen\\x02etrable armour-plating; others search for new and deadlier \\r\\ngases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in \\r\\nsuch quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole con\\x02tinents, or for breeds of disease germs immunized against \\r\\nall possible antibodies; others strive to produce a vehicle \\r\\nthat shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine un\\x02der the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base \\r\\nas a sailing-ship; others explore even remoter possibilities \\r\\nsuch as focusing the sun’s rays through lenses suspended \\r\\nthousands of kilometres away in space, or producing artifi\\x02cial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the \\r\\nearth’s centre.\\r\\nBut none of these projects ever comes anywhere near re\\x02alization, and none of the three super-states ever gains a \\r\\nsignificant lead on the others. What is more remarkable is \\n246 1984\\r\\nthat all three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb, \\r\\na weapon far more powerful than any that their present \\r\\nresearches are likely to discover. Although the Party, ac\\x02cording to its habit, claims the invention for itself, atomic \\r\\nbombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties, and \\r\\nwere first used on a large scale about ten years later. At that \\r\\ntime some hundreds of bombs were dropped on indus\\x02trial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe, \\r\\nand North America. The effect was to convince the ruling \\r\\ngroups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would \\r\\nmean the end of organized society, and hence of their own \\r\\npower. Thereafter, although no formal agreement was ever \\r\\nmade or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All three \\r\\npowers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store \\r\\nthem up against the decisive opportunity which they all \\r\\nbelieve will come sooner or later. And meanwhile the art \\r\\nof war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty \\r\\nyears. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, \\r\\nbombing planes have been largely superseded by self-pro\\x02pelled projectiles, and the fragile movable battleship has \\r\\ngiven way to the almost unsinkable Floating Fortress; but \\r\\notherwise there has been little development. The tank, the \\r\\nsubmarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and \\r\\nthe hand grenade are still in use. And in spite of the end\\x02less slaughters reported in the Press and on the telescreens, \\r\\nthe desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds of \\r\\nthousands or even millions of men were often killed in a \\r\\nfew weeks, have never been repeated.\\r\\nNone of the three super-states ever attempts any ma-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 247\\r\\nnoeuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat. When \\r\\nany large operation is undertaken, it is usually a surprise \\r\\nattack against an ally. The strategy that all three powers are \\r\\nfollowing, or pretend to themselves that they are following, \\r\\nis the same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bar\\x02gaining, and well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a \\r\\nring of bases completely encircling one or other of the ri\\x02val states, and then to sign a pact of friendship with that \\r\\nrival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to \\r\\nlull suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded with \\r\\natomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; \\r\\nfinally they will all be fired simultaneously, with effects so \\r\\ndevastating as to make retaliation impossible. It will then be \\r\\ntime to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world\\x02power, in preparation for another attack. This scheme, it is \\r\\nhardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of \\r\\nrealization. Moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the \\r\\ndisputed areas round the Equator and the Pole: no invasion \\r\\nof enemy territory is ever undertaken. This explains the fact \\r\\nthat in some places the frontiers between the superstates \\r\\nare arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the \\r\\nBritish Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on \\r\\nthe other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its \\r\\nfrontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula. But this would \\r\\nviolate the principle, followed on all sides though never \\r\\nformulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were to con\\x02quer the areas that used once to be known as France and \\r\\nGermany, it would be necessary either to exterminate the \\r\\ninhabitants, a task of great physical difficulty, or to assimi-\\n248 1984\\r\\nlate a population of about a hundred million people, who, \\r\\nso far as technical development goes, are roughly on the \\r\\nOceanic level. The problem is the same for all three super\\x02states. It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there \\r\\nshould be no contact with foreigners, except, to a limited \\r\\nextent, with war prisoners and coloured slaves. Even the of\\x02ficial ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest \\r\\nsuspicion. War prisoners apart, the average citizen of Ocea\\x02nia never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia, \\r\\nand he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If \\r\\nhe were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover \\r\\nthat they are creatures similar to himself and that most of \\r\\nwhat he has been told about them is lies. The sealed world \\r\\nin which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, \\r\\nand self-righteousness on which his morale depends might \\r\\nevaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that however \\r\\noften Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands, \\r\\nthe main frontiers must never be crossed by anything ex\\x02cept bombs.\\r\\nUnder this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly \\r\\nunderstood and acted upon: namely, that the conditions of \\r\\nlife in all three super-states are very much the same. In Oce\\x02ania the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc, in Eurasia \\r\\nit is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is called by \\r\\na Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but \\r\\nperhaps better rendered as Obliteration of the Self. The citi\\x02zen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets \\r\\nof the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate \\r\\nthem as barbarous outrages upon morality and common \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 249\\r\\nsense. Actually the three philosophies are barely distin\\x02guishable, and the social systems which they support are \\r\\nnot distinguishable at all. Everywhere there is the same py\\x02ramidal structure, the same worship of semi-divine leader, \\r\\nthe same economy existing by and for continuous warfare. \\r\\nIt follows that the three super-states not only cannot con\\x02quer one another, but would gain no advantage by doing \\r\\nso. On the contrary, so long as they remain in conflict they \\r\\nprop one another up, like three sheaves of corn. And, as \\r\\nusual, the ruling groups of all three powers are simultane\\x02ously aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives \\r\\nare dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it \\r\\nis necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and \\r\\nwithout victory. Meanwhile the fact that there IS no danger \\r\\nof conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the \\r\\nspecial feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of thought. \\r\\nHere it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that \\r\\nby becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed \\r\\nits character.\\r\\nIn past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something \\r\\nthat sooner or later came to an end, usually in unmistak\\x02able victory or defeat. In the past, also, war was one of the \\r\\nmain instruments by which human societies were kept in \\r\\ntouch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have tried \\r\\nto impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but \\r\\nthey could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended \\r\\nto impair military efficiency. So long as defeat meant the \\r\\nloss of independence, or some other result generally held \\r\\nto be undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be \\n250 1984\\r\\nserious. Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, \\r\\nor religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make \\r\\nfive, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they \\r\\nhad to make four. Inefficient nations were always conquered \\r\\nsooner or later, and the struggle for efficiency was inimi\\x02cal to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was necessary to \\r\\nbe able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly \\r\\naccurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspa\\x02pers and history books were, of course, always coloured and \\r\\nbiased, but falsification of the kind that is practised today \\r\\nwould have been impossible. War was a sure safeguard of \\r\\nsanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was \\r\\nprobably the most important of all safeguards. While wars \\r\\ncould be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely ir\\x02responsible.\\r\\nBut when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases \\r\\nto be dangerous. When war is continuous there is no such \\r\\nthing as military necessity. Technical progress can cease \\r\\nand the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded. \\r\\nAs we have seen, researches that could be called scientific \\r\\nare still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are es\\x02sentially a kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show \\r\\nresults is not important. Efficiency, even military efficiency, \\r\\nis no longer needed. Nothing is efficient in Oceania except \\r\\nthe Thought Police. Since each of the three super-states is \\r\\nunconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within \\r\\nwhich almost any perversion of thought can be safely prac\\x02tised. Reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of \\r\\neveryday life—the need to eat and drink, to get shelter and \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 251\\r\\nclothing, to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of top\\x02storey windows, and the like. Between life and death, and \\r\\nbetween physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still \\r\\na distinction, but that is all. Cut off from contact with the \\r\\nouter world, and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is \\r\\nlike a man in interstellar space, who has no way of know\\x02ing which direction is up and which is down. The rulers of \\r\\nsuch a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesars \\r\\ncould not be. They are obliged to prevent their followers \\r\\nfrom starving to death in numbers large enough to be in\\x02convenient, and they are obliged to remain at the same \\r\\nlow level of military technique as their rivals; but once that \\r\\nminimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever \\r\\nshape they choose.\\r\\nThe war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of pre\\x02vious wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles \\r\\nbetween certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at \\r\\nsuch an angle that they are incapable of hurting one anoth\\x02er. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up \\r\\nthe surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve \\r\\nthe special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society \\r\\nneeds. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. \\r\\nIn the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although \\r\\nthey might recognize their common interest and therefore \\r\\nlimit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one an\\x02other, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In \\r\\nour own day they are not fighting against one another at \\r\\nall. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own \\r\\nsubjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent \\n252 1984\\r\\nconquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society \\r\\nintact. The very word ‘war’, therefore, has become mislead\\x02ing. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming \\r\\ncontinuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure \\r\\nthat it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age \\r\\nand the early twentieth century has disappeared and been \\r\\nreplaced by something quite different. The effect would be \\r\\nmuch the same if the three super-states, instead of fighting \\r\\none another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each \\r\\ninviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each \\r\\nwould still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever from \\r\\nthe sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was \\r\\ntruly permanent would be the same as a permanent war. \\r\\nThis—although the vast majority of Party members under\\x02stand it only in a shallower sense—is the inner meaning of \\r\\nthe Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.\\r\\nWinston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in \\r\\nremote distance a rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feel\\x02ing of being alone with the forbidden book, in a room with \\r\\nno telescreen, had not worn off. Solitude and safety were \\r\\nphysical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness \\r\\nof his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint \\r\\nbreeze from the window that played upon his cheek. The \\r\\nbook fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him. In \\r\\na sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part \\r\\nof the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had \\r\\nbeen possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in or\\x02der. It was the product of a mind similar to his own, but \\r\\nenormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-rid-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 253\\r\\nden. The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you \\r\\nwhat you know already. He had just turned back to Chapter \\r\\nI when he heard Julia’s footstep on the stair and started out \\r\\nof his chair to meet her. She dumped her brown tool-bag on \\r\\nthe floor and flung herself into his arms. It was more than a \\r\\nweek since they had seen one another.\\r\\n‘I’ve got THE BOOK,’ he said as they disentangled them\\x02selves.\\r\\n‘Oh, you’ve got it? Good,’ she said without much interest, \\r\\nand almost immediately knelt down beside the oil stove to \\r\\nmake the coffee.\\r\\nThey did not return to the subject until they had been \\r\\nin bed for half an hour. The evening was just cool enough \\r\\nto make it worth while to pull up the counterpane. From \\r\\nbelow came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape \\r\\nof boots on the flagstones. The brawny red-armed woman \\r\\nwhom Winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a \\r\\nfixture in the yard. There seemed to be no hour of daylight \\r\\nwhen she was not marching to and fro between the washtub \\r\\nand the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs \\r\\nand breaking forth into lusty song. Julia had settled down \\r\\non her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling \\r\\nasleep. He reached out for the book, which was lying on the \\r\\nfloor, and sat up against the bedhead.\\r\\n‘We must read it,’ he said. ‘You too. All members of the \\r\\nBrotherhood have to read it.’\\r\\n‘You read it,’ she said with her eyes shut. ‘Read it aloud. \\r\\nThat’s the best way. Then you can explain it to me as you \\r\\ngo.’\\n254 1984\\r\\nThe clock’s hands said six, meaning eighteen. They had \\r\\nthree or four hours ahead of them. He propped the book \\r\\nagainst his knees and began reading:\\r\\nChapter I Ignorance is Strength\\r\\nThroughout recorded time, and probably since the end \\r\\nof the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people \\r\\nin the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have \\r\\nbeen subdivided in many ways, they have borne count\\x02less different names, and their relative numbers, as well as \\r\\ntheir attitude towards one another, have varied from age to \\r\\nage: but the essential structure of society has never altered. \\r\\nEven after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable \\r\\nchanges, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just \\r\\nas a gyroscope will always return to equilibnum, however \\r\\nfar it is pushed one way or the other\\r\\n‘Julia, are you awake?’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘Yes, my love, I’m listening. Go on. It’s marvellous.’\\r\\nHe continued reading:\\r\\nThe aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcil\\x02able. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The \\r\\naim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The \\r\\naim of the Low, when they have an aim—for it is an abiding \\r\\ncharacteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed \\r\\nby drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of \\r\\nanything outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinc\\x02tions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. \\r\\nThus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its \\r\\nmain outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods \\r\\nthe High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 255\\r\\nthere always comes a moment when they lose either their \\r\\nbelief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, \\r\\nor both. They are then overthrown by the Middle, who en\\x02list the Low on their side by pretending to them that they \\r\\nare fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have \\r\\nreached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back \\r\\ninto their old position of servitude, and themselves become \\r\\nthe High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from one \\r\\nof the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle \\r\\nbegins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are \\r\\nnever even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. \\r\\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history \\r\\nthere has been no progress of a material kind. Even today, \\r\\nin a period of decline, the average human being is physical\\x02ly better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance \\r\\nin wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolu\\x02tion has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. \\r\\nFrom the point of view of the Low, no historic change has \\r\\never meant much more than a change in the name of their \\r\\nmasters.\\r\\nBy the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pat\\x02tern had become obvious to many observers. There then \\r\\nrose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cy\\x02clical process and claimed to show that inequality was the \\r\\nunalterable law of human life. This doctrine, of course, had \\r\\nalways had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was \\r\\nnow put forward there was a significant change. In the past \\r\\nthe need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doc\\x02trine specifically of the High. It had been preached by kings \\n256 1984\\r\\nand aristocrats and by the priests, lawyers, and the like who \\r\\nwere parasitical upon them, and it had generally been soft\\x02ened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world \\r\\nbeyond the grave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling \\r\\nfor power, had always made use of such terms as freedom, \\r\\njustice, and fraternity. Now, however, the concept of hu\\x02man brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were \\r\\nnot yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so \\r\\nbefore long. In the past the Middle had made revolutions \\r\\nunder the banner of equality, and then had established a \\r\\nfresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown. The \\r\\nnew Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny be\\x02forehand. Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early \\r\\nnineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of \\r\\nthought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity, \\r\\nwas still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages. But \\r\\nin each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 \\r\\nonwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was \\r\\nmore and more openly abandoned. The new movements \\r\\nwhich appeared in the middle years of the century, Ingsoc \\r\\nin Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as \\r\\nit is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim \\r\\nof perpetuating UNfreedom and INequality. These new \\r\\nmovements, of course, grew out of the old ones and tended \\r\\nto keep their names and pay lip-service to their ideology. \\r\\nBut the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and \\r\\nfreeze history at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulum \\r\\nswing was to happen once more, and then stop. As usual, \\r\\nthe High were to be turned out by the Middle, who would \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 257\\r\\nthen become the High; but this time, by conscious strategy, \\r\\nthe High would be able to maintain their position perma\\x02nently.\\r\\nThe new doctrines arose partly because of the accu\\x02mulation of historical knowledge, and the growth of the \\r\\nhistorical sense, which had hardly existed before the nine\\x02teenth century. The cyclical movement of history was now \\r\\nintelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, \\r\\nthen it was alterable. But the principal, underlying cause \\r\\nwas that, as early as the beginning of the twentieth century, \\r\\nhuman equality had become technically possible. It was still \\r\\ntrue that men were not equal in their native talents and that \\r\\nfunctions had to be specialized in ways that favoured some \\r\\nindividuals against others; but there was no longer any real \\r\\nneed for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. \\r\\nIn earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevi\\x02table but desirable. Inequality was the price of civilization. \\r\\nWith the development of machine production, however, the \\r\\ncase was altered. Even if it was still necessary for human \\r\\nbeings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer neces\\x02sary for them to live at different social or economic levels. \\r\\nTherefore, from the point of view of the new groups who \\r\\nwere on the point of seizing power, human equality was no \\r\\nlonger an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to be avert\\x02ed. In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society \\r\\nwas in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. \\r\\nThe idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live \\r\\ntogether in a state of brotherhood, without laws and with\\x02out brute labour, had haunted the human imagination for \\n258 1984\\r\\nthousands of years. And this vision had had a certain hold \\r\\neven on the groups who actually profited by each histori\\x02cal change. The heirs of the French, English, and American \\r\\nrevolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about \\r\\nthe rights of man, freedom of speech, equality before the \\r\\nlaw, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to \\r\\nbe influenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth \\r\\ndecade of the twentieth century all the main currents of \\r\\npolitical thought were authoritarian. The earthly paradise \\r\\nhad been discredited at exactly the moment when it became \\r\\nrealizable. Every new political theory, by whatever name it \\r\\ncalled itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And \\r\\nin the general hardening of outlook that set in round about \\r\\n1930, practices which had been long abandoned, in some \\r\\ncases for hundreds of years—imprisonment without trial, \\r\\nthe use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture \\r\\nto extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the depor\\x02tation of whole populations—not only became common \\r\\nagain, but were tolerated and even defended by people who \\r\\nconsidered themselves enlightened and progressive.\\r\\nIt was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, \\r\\nrevolutions, and counter-revolutions in all parts of the \\r\\nworld that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully worked\\x02out political theories. But they had been foreshadowed by \\r\\nthe various systems, generally called totalitarian, which \\r\\nhad appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines \\r\\nof the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos \\r\\nhad long been obvious. What kind of people would control \\r\\nthis world had been equally obvious. The new aristocracy \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 259\\r\\nwas made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists, \\r\\ntechnicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, so\\x02ciologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. \\r\\nThese people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle class \\r\\nand the upper grades of the working class, had been shaped \\r\\nand brought together by the barren world of monopoly in\\x02dustry and centralized government. As compared with \\r\\ntheir opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avari\\x02cious, less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, \\r\\nabove all, more conscious of what they were doing and \\r\\nmore intent on crushing opposition. This last difference was \\r\\ncardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all the \\r\\ntyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. The \\r\\nruling groups were always infected to some extent by lib\\x02eral ideas, and were content to leave loose ends everywhere, \\r\\nto regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what \\r\\ntheir subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church of \\r\\nthe Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of \\r\\nthe reason for this was that in the past no government had \\r\\nthe power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance. \\r\\nThe invention of print, however, made it easier to manipu\\x02late public opinion, and the film and the radio carried the \\r\\nprocess further. With the development of television, and \\r\\nthe technical advance which made it possible to receive and \\r\\ntransmit simultaneously on the same instrument, private \\r\\nlife came to an end. Every citizen, or at least every citizen \\r\\nimportant enough to be worth watching, could be kept for \\r\\ntwenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police and in \\r\\nthe sound of official propaganda, with all other channels \\n260 1984\\r\\nof communication closed. The possibility of enforcing not \\r\\nonly complete obedience to the will of the State, but com\\x02plete uniformity of opinion on all subjects, now existed for \\r\\nthe first time.\\r\\nAfter the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, \\r\\nsociety regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and \\r\\nLow. But the new High group, unlike all its forerunners, did \\r\\nnot act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard \\r\\nits position. It had long been realized that the only secure \\r\\nbasis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege are \\r\\nmost easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The \\r\\nso-called ‘abolition of private property’ which took place in \\r\\nthe middle years of the century meant, in effect, the con\\x02centration of property in far fewer hands than before: but \\r\\nwith this difference, that the new owners were a group in\\x02stead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of \\r\\nthe Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. \\r\\nCollectively, the Party owns everything in Oceania, be\\x02cause it controls everything, and disposes of the products \\r\\nas it thinks fit. In the years following the Revolution it was \\r\\nable to step into this commanding position almost unop\\x02posed, because the whole process was represented as an act \\r\\nof collectivization. It had always been assumed that if the \\r\\ncapitalist class were expropriated, Socialism must follow: \\r\\nand unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated. \\r\\nFactories, mines, land, houses, transport—everything had \\r\\nbeen taken away from them: and since these things were \\r\\nno longer private property, it followed that they must be \\r\\npublic property. Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier So-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 261\\r\\ncialist movement and inherited its phraseology, has in fact \\r\\ncarried out the main item in the Socialist programme; with \\r\\nthe result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that econom\\x02ic inequality has been made permanent.\\r\\nBut the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical soci\\x02ety go deeper than this. There are only four ways in which \\r\\na ruling group can fall from power. Either it is conquered \\r\\nfrom without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses \\r\\nare stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented \\r\\nMiddle group to come into being, or it loses its own self\\x02confidence and willingness to govern. These causes do not \\r\\noperate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present in \\r\\nsome degree. A ruling class which could guard against all \\r\\nof them would remain in power permanently. Ultimately \\r\\nthe determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling \\r\\nclass itself.\\r\\nAfter the middle of the present century, the first dan\\x02ger had in reality disappeared. Each of the three powers \\r\\nwhich now divide the world is in fact unconquerable, and \\r\\ncould only become conquerable through slow demographic \\r\\nchanges which a government with wide powers can easi\\x02ly avert. The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one. \\r\\nThe masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never \\r\\nrevolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long \\r\\nas they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, \\r\\nthey never even become aware that they are oppressed. The \\r\\nrecurrent economic crises of past times were totally un\\x02necessary and are not now permitted to happen, but other \\r\\nand equally large dislocations can and do happen without \\n262 1984\\r\\nhaving political results, because there is no way in which \\r\\ndiscontent can become articulate. As for the problem of \\r\\nover-production, which has been latent in our society since \\r\\nthe development of machine technique, it is solved by the \\r\\ndevice of continuous warfare (see Chapter III), which is \\r\\nalso useful in keying up public morale to the necessary \\r\\npitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, there\\x02fore, the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new \\r\\ngroup of able, under-employed, power-hungry people, and \\r\\nthe growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own ranks. \\r\\nThe problem, that is to say, is educational. It is a problem \\r\\nof continuously moulding the consciousness both of the \\r\\ndirecting group and of the larger executive group that lies \\r\\nimmediately below it. The consciousness of the masses \\r\\nneeds only to be influenced in a negative way.\\r\\nGiven this background, one could infer, if one did not \\r\\nknow it already, the general structure of Oceanic society. At \\r\\nthe apex of the pyramid comes Big Brother. Big Brother is in\\x02fallible and all-powerful. Every success, every achievement, \\r\\nevery victory, every scientific discovery, all knowledge, all \\r\\nwisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue directly \\r\\nfrom his leadership and inspiration. Nobody has ever seen \\r\\nBig Brother. He is a face on the hoardings, a voice on the \\r\\ntelescreen. We may be reasonably sure that he will never die, \\r\\nand there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he \\r\\nwas born. Big Brother is the guise in which the Party choos\\x02es to exhibit itself to the world. His function is to act as a \\r\\nfocusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which \\r\\nare more easily felt towards an individual than towards an \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 263\\r\\norganization. Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party. Its \\r\\nnumbers limited to six millions, or something less than \\r\\n2 per cent of the population of Oceania. Below the Inner \\r\\nParty comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is de\\x02scribed as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to the \\r\\nhands. Below that come the dumb masses whom we habitu\\x02ally refer to as ‘the proles’, numbering perhaps 85 per cent of \\r\\nthe population. In the terms of our earlier classification, the \\r\\nproles are the Low: for the slave population of the equatori\\x02al lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror, \\r\\nare not a permanent or necessary part of the structure.\\r\\nIn principle, membership of these three groups is not he\\x02reditary. The child of Inner Party parents is in theory not \\r\\nborn into the Inner Party. Admission to either branch of the \\r\\nParty is by examination, taken at the age of sixteen. Nor is \\r\\nthere any racial discrimination, or any marked domination \\r\\nof one province by another. Jews, Negroes, South Ameri\\x02cans of pure Indian blood are to be found in the highest \\r\\nranks of the Party, and the administrators of any area are \\r\\nalways drawn from the inhabitants of that area. In no part \\r\\nof Oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are \\r\\na colonial population ruled from a distant capital. Ocea\\x02nia has no capital, and its titular head is a person whose \\r\\nwhereabouts nobody knows. Except that English is its chief \\r\\nLINGUA FRANCA and Newspeak its official language, it is \\r\\nnot centralized in any way. Its rulers are not held together \\r\\nby blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. It \\r\\nis true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly strat\\x02ified, on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines. \\n264 1984\\r\\nThere is far less to-and-fro movement between the differ\\x02ent groups than happened under capitalism or even in the \\r\\npre-industrial age. Between the two branches of the Party \\r\\nthere is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much \\r\\nas will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the Inner \\r\\nParty and that ambitious members of the Outer Party are \\r\\nmade harmless by allowing them to rise. Proletarians, in \\r\\npractice, are not allowed to graduate into the Party. The \\r\\nmost gifted among them, who might possibly become nu\\x02clei of discontent, are simply marked down by the Thought \\r\\nPolice and eliminated. But this state of affairs is not neces\\x02sarily permanent, nor is it a matter of principle. The Party \\r\\nis not a class in the old sense of the word. It does not aim \\r\\nat transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if \\r\\nthere were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the \\r\\ntop, it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new \\r\\ngeneration from the ranks of the proletariat. In the crucial \\r\\nyears, the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did \\r\\na great deal to neutralize opposition. The older kind of So\\x02cialist, who had been trained to fight against something \\r\\ncalled ‘class privilege’ assumed that what is not hereditary \\r\\ncannot be permanent. He did not see that the continuity \\r\\nof an oligarchy need not be physical, nor did he pause to \\r\\nreflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been short\\x02lived, whereas adoptive organizations such as the Catholic \\r\\nChurch have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands \\r\\nof years. The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son \\r\\ninheritance, but the persistence of a certain world-view and \\r\\na certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon the living. A \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 265\\r\\nruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its \\r\\nsuccessors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating \\r\\nits blood but with perpetuating itself. WHO wields power \\r\\nis not important, provided that the hierarchical structure \\r\\nremains always the same.\\r\\nAll the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes \\r\\nthat characterize our time are really designed to sustain the \\r\\nmystique of the Party and prevent the true nature of pres\\x02ent-day society from being perceived. Physical rebellion, or \\r\\nany preliminary move towards rebellion, is at present not \\r\\npossible. From the proletarians nothing is to be feared. Left \\r\\nto themselves, they will continue from generation to gener\\x02ation and from century to century, working, breeding, and \\r\\ndying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without \\r\\nthe power of grasping that the world could be other than it \\r\\nis. They could only become dangerous if the advance of in\\x02dustrial technique made it necessary to educate them more \\r\\nhighly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are no \\r\\nlonger important, the level of popular education is actually \\r\\ndeclining. What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, \\r\\nis looked on as a matter of indifference. They can be granted \\r\\nintellectual liberty because they have no intellect. In a Party \\r\\nmember, on the other hand, not even the smallest deviation \\r\\nof opinion on the most unimportant subject can be toler\\x02ated.\\r\\nA Party member lives from birth to death under the eye \\r\\nof the Thought Police. Even when he is alone he can never be \\r\\nsure that he is alone. Wherever he may be, asleep or awake, \\r\\nworking or resting, in his bath or in bed, he can be inspected \\n266 1984\\r\\nwithout warning and without knowing that he is being in\\x02spected. Nothing that he does is indifferent. His friendships, \\r\\nhis relaxations, his behaviour towards his wife and children, \\r\\nthe expression of his face when he is alone, the words he \\r\\nmutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements of his \\r\\nbody, are all jealously scrutinized. Not only any actual mis\\x02demeanour, but any eccentricity, however small, any change \\r\\nof habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be \\r\\nthe symptom of an inner struggle, is certain to be detected. \\r\\nHe has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever. On \\r\\nthe other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any \\r\\nclearly formulated code of behaviour. In Oceania there is \\r\\nno law. Thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean \\r\\ncertain death are not formally forbidden, and the endless \\r\\npurges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations \\r\\nare not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have ac\\x02tually been committed, but are merely the wiping-out of \\r\\npersons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in \\r\\nthe future. A Party member is required to have not only the \\r\\nright opinions, but the right instincts. Many of the beliefs \\r\\nand attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated, and \\r\\ncould not be stated without laying bare the contradictions \\r\\ninherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox (in \\r\\nNewspeak a GOODTHINKER), he will in all circumstanc\\x02es know, without taking thought, what is the true belief or \\r\\nthe desirable emotion. But in any case an elaborate men\\x02tal training, undergone in childhood and grouping itself \\r\\nround the Newspeak words CRIMESTOP, BLACKWHITE, \\r\\nand DOUBLETHINK, makes him unwilling and unable to \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 267\\r\\nthink too deeply on any subject whatever.\\r\\nA Party member is expected to have no private emotions \\r\\nand no respites from enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a \\r\\ncontinuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal \\r\\ntraitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement before \\r\\nthe power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents pro\\x02duced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned \\r\\noutwards and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes \\r\\nHate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a \\r\\nsceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his \\r\\nearly acquired inner discipline. The first and simplest stage \\r\\nin the discipline, which can be taught even to young chil\\x02dren, is called, in Newspeak, CRIMESTOP. CRIMESTOP \\r\\nmeans the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, \\r\\nat the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the \\r\\npower of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logi\\x02cal errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if \\r\\nthey are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled \\r\\nby any train of thought which is capable of leading in a \\r\\nheretical direction. CRIMESTOP, in short, means protec\\x02tive stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On the contrary, \\r\\northodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one’s \\r\\nown mental processes as complete as that of a contortion\\x02ist over his body. Oceanic society rests ultimately on the \\r\\nbelief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is \\r\\ninfallible. But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent \\r\\nand the party is not infallible, there is need for an unwea\\x02rying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of \\r\\nfacts. The keyword here is BLACKWHITE. Like so many \\n268 1984\\r\\nNewspeak words, this word has two mutually contradicto\\x02ry meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of \\r\\nimpudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of \\r\\nthe plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal \\r\\nwillingness to say that black is white when Party discipline \\r\\ndemands this. But it means also the ability to BELIEVE that \\r\\nblack is white, and more, to KNOW that black is white, and \\r\\nto forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This de\\x02mands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible \\r\\nby the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, \\r\\nand which is known in Newspeak as DOUBLETHINK.\\r\\nThe alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, \\r\\none of which is subsidiary and, so to speak, precaution\\x02ary. The subsidiary reason is that the Party member, like \\r\\nthe proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly be\\x02cause he has no standards of comparison. He must be cut \\r\\noff from the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign \\r\\ncountries, because it is necessary for him to believe that \\r\\nhe is better off than his ancestors and that the average lev\\x02el of material comfort is constantly rising. But by far the \\r\\nmore important reason for the readjustment of the past is \\r\\nthe need to safeguard the infallibility of the Party. It is not \\r\\nmerely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind \\r\\nmust be constantly brought up to date in order to show that \\r\\nthe predictions of the Party were in all cases right. It is also \\r\\nthat no change in doctrine or in political alignment can \\r\\never be admitted. For to change one’s mind, or even one’s \\r\\npolicy, is a confession of weakness. If, for example, Eurasia \\r\\nor Eastasia (whichever it may be) is the enemy today, then \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 269\\r\\nthat country must always have been the enemy. And if the \\r\\nfacts say otherwise then the facts must be altered. Thus his\\x02tory is continuously rewritten. This day-to-day falsification \\r\\nof the past, carried out by the Ministry of Truth, is as neces\\x02sary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression \\r\\nand espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love.\\r\\nThe mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. \\r\\nPast events, it is argued, have no objective existence, but \\r\\nsurvive only in written records and in human memories. \\r\\nThe past is whatever the records and the memories agree \\r\\nupon. And since the Party is in full control of all records \\r\\nand in equally full control of the minds of its members, it \\r\\nfollows that the past is whatever the Party chooses to make \\r\\nit. It also follows that though the past is alterable, it never \\r\\nhas been altered in any specific instance. For when it has \\r\\nbeen recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, \\r\\nthen this new version IS the past, and no different past can \\r\\never have existed. This holds good even when, as often hap\\x02pens, the same event has to be altered out of recognition \\r\\nseveral times in the course of a year. At all times the Party \\r\\nis in possession of absolute truth, and clearly the absolute \\r\\ncan never have been different from what it is now. It will \\r\\nbe seen that the control of the past depends above all on \\r\\nthe training of memory. To make sure that all written re\\x02cords agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely \\r\\na mechanical act. But it is also necessary to REMEMBER \\r\\nthat events happened in the desired manner. And if it is \\r\\nnecessary to rearrange one’s memories or to tamper with \\r\\nwritten records, then it is necessary to FORGET that one \\n270 1984\\r\\nhas done so. The trick of doing this can be learned like any \\r\\nother mental technique. It is learned by the majority of Par\\x02ty members, and certainly by all who are intelligent as well \\r\\nas orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, ‘reality \\r\\ncontrol’. In Newspeak it is called DOUBLETHINK, though \\r\\nDOUBLETHINK comprises much else as well.\\r\\nDOUBLETHINK means the power of holding two \\r\\ncontradictory beliefs in one’s mind simultaneously, and ac\\x02cepting both of them. The Party intellectual knows in which \\r\\ndirection his memories must be altered; he therefore knows \\r\\nthat he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of \\r\\nDOUBLETHINK he also satisfies himself that reality is not \\r\\nviolated. The process has to be conscious, or it would not \\r\\nbe carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be \\r\\nunconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and \\r\\nhence of guilt. DOUBLETHINK lies at the very heart of In\\x02gsoc, since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious \\r\\ndeception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes \\r\\nwith complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genu\\x02inely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become \\r\\ninconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, \\r\\nto draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, \\r\\nto deny the existence of objective reality and all the while \\r\\nto take account of the reality which one denies—all this is \\r\\nindispensably necessary. Even in using the word DOUBLE\\x02THINK it is necessary to exercise DOUBLETHINK. For \\r\\nby using the word one admits that one is tampering with \\r\\nreality; by a fresh act of DOUBLETHINK one erases this \\r\\nknowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 271\\r\\nleap ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by means of DOU\\x02BLETHINK that the Party has been able—and may, for all \\r\\nwe know, continue to be able for thousands of years—to ar\\x02rest the course of history.\\r\\nAll past oligarchies have fallen from power either because \\r\\nthey ossified or because they grew soft. Either they became \\r\\nstupid and arrogant, failed to adjust themselves to chang\\x02ing circumstances, and were overthrown; or they became \\r\\nliberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should \\r\\nhave used force, and once again were overthrown. They fell, \\r\\nthat is to say, either through consciousness or through un\\x02consciousness. It is the achievement of the Party to have \\r\\nproduced a system of thought in which both conditions can \\r\\nexist simultaneously. And upon no other intellectual basis \\r\\ncould the dominion of the Party be made permanent. If one \\r\\nis to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to dis\\x02locate the sense of reality. For the secret of rulership is to \\r\\ncombine a belief in one’s own infallibility with the Power to \\r\\nlearn from past mistakes.\\r\\nIt need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of \\r\\nDOUBLETHINK are those who invented DOUBLETHINK \\r\\nand know that it is a vast system of mental cheating. In \\r\\nour society, those who have the best knowledge of what is \\r\\nhappening are also those who are furthest from seeing the \\r\\nworld as it is. In general, the greater the understanding, the \\r\\ngreater the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane. One \\r\\nclear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increas\\x02es in intensity as one rises in the social scale. Those whose \\r\\nattitude towards the war is most nearly rational are the sub-\\n272 1984\\r\\nject peoples of the disputed territories. To these people the \\r\\nwar is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and \\r\\nfro over their bodies like a tidal wave. Which side is win\\x02ning is a matter of complete indifference to them. They are \\r\\naware that a change of overlordship means simply that they \\r\\nwill be doing the same work as before for new masters who \\r\\ntreat them in the same manner as the old ones. The slightly \\r\\nmore favoured workers whom we call ‘the proles’ are only \\r\\nintermittently conscious of the war. When it is necessary \\r\\nthey can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred, but \\r\\nwhen left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for \\r\\nlong periods that the war is happening. It is in the ranks of \\r\\nthe Party, and above all of the Inner Party, that the true war \\r\\nenthusiasm is found. World-conquest is believed in most \\r\\nfirmly by those who know it to be impossible. This peculiar \\r\\nlinking-together of opposites—knowledge with ignorance, \\r\\ncynicism with fanaticism—is one of the chief distinguish\\x02ing marks of Oceanic society. The official ideology abounds \\r\\nwith contradictions even when there is no practical reason \\r\\nfor them. Thus, the Party rejects and vilifies every principle \\r\\nfor which the Socialist movement originally stood, and it \\r\\nchooses to do this in the name of Socialism. It preaches a \\r\\ncontempt for the working class unexampled for centuries \\r\\npast, and it dresses its members in a uniform which was at \\r\\none time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for \\r\\nthat reason. It systematically undermines the solidarity of \\r\\nthe family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct \\r\\nappeal to the sentiment of family loyalty. Even the names of \\r\\nthe four Ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 273\\r\\nof impudence in their deliberate reversal of the facts. The \\r\\nMinistry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of \\r\\nTruth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the \\r\\nMinistry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions \\r\\nare not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypoc\\x02risy; they are deliberate exercises in DOUBLETHINK. For \\r\\nit is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be \\r\\nretained indefinitely. In no other way could the ancient cy\\x02cle be broken. If human equality is to be for ever averted—if \\r\\nthe High, as we have called them, are to keep their places \\r\\npermanently—then the prevailing mental condition must \\r\\nbe controlled insanity.\\r\\nBut there is one question which until this moment we \\r\\nhave almost ignored. It is; WHY should human equality be \\r\\naverted? Supposing that the mechanics of the process have \\r\\nbeen rightly described, what is the motive for this huge, \\r\\naccurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular \\r\\nmoment of time?\\r\\nHere we reach the central secret. As we have seen. the \\r\\nmystique of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, de\\x02pends upon DOUBLETHINK But deeper than this lies the \\r\\noriginal motive, the never-questioned instinct that first led \\r\\nto the seizure of power and brought DOUBLETHINK, the \\r\\nThought Police, continuous warfare, and all the other nec\\x02essary paraphernalia into existence afterwards. This motive \\r\\nreally consists...\\r\\nWinston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware \\r\\nof a new sound. It seemed to him that Julia had been very \\r\\nstill for some time past. She was lying on her side, na-\\n274 1984\\r\\nked from the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowed on \\r\\nher hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. Her \\r\\nbreast rose and fell slowly and regularly.\\r\\n‘Julia.’\\r\\nNo answer.\\r\\n‘Julia, are you awake?’\\r\\nNo answer. She was asleep. He shut the book, put it care\\x02fully on the floor, lay down, and pulled the coverlet over \\r\\nboth of them.\\r\\nHe had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret. \\r\\nHe understood HOW; he did not understand WHY. Chap\\x02ter I, like Chapter III, had not actually told him anything \\r\\nthat he did not know, it had merely systematized the knowl\\x02edge that he possessed already. But after reading it he knew \\r\\nbetter than before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, \\r\\neven a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was \\r\\ntruth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth \\r\\neven against the whole world, you were not mad. A yellow \\r\\nbeam from the sinking sun slanted in through the window \\r\\nand fell across the pillow. He shut his eyes. The sun on his \\r\\nface and the girl’s smooth body touching his own gave him \\r\\na strong, sleepy, confident feeling. He was safe, everything \\r\\nwas all right. He fell asleep murmuring ‘Sanity is not sta\\x02tistical,’ with the feeling that this remark contained in it a \\r\\nprofound wisdom.\\r\\n*****\\r\\nWhen he woke it was with the sensation of having slept \\r\\nfor a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told \\r\\nhim that it was only twenty-thirty. He lay dozing for a while; \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 275\\r\\nthen the usual deep-lunged singing struck up from the yard \\r\\nbelow:\\r\\n‘It was only an ‘opeless fancy, \\r\\nIt passed like an Ipril dye, \\r\\nBut a look an’ a word an’ the dreams they stirred \\r\\nThey ‘ave stolen my ‘eart awye!’\\r\\nThe driveling song seemed to have kept its popularity. \\r\\nYou still heard it all over the place. It had outlived the Hate \\r\\nSong. Julia woke at the sound, stretched herself luxuriously, \\r\\nand got out of bed.\\r\\n‘I’m hungry,’ she said. ‘Let’s make some more coffee. \\r\\nDamn! The stove’s gone out and the water’s cold.’ She picked \\r\\nthe stove up and shook it. ‘There’s no oil in it.’\\r\\n‘We can get some from old Charrington, I expect.’\\r\\n‘The funny thing is I made sure it was full. I’m going to \\r\\nput my clothes on,’ she added. ‘It seems to have got colder.’\\r\\nWinston also got up and dressed himself. The indefati\\x02gable voice sang on:\\r\\n‘They sye that time ‘eals all things, \\r\\nThey sye you can always forget; \\r\\nBut the smiles an’ the tears acrorss the years \\r\\nThey twist my ‘eart-strings yet!’\\r\\nAs he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across \\r\\nto the window. The sun must have gone down behind the \\r\\nhouses; it was not shining into the yard any longer. The flag-\\n276 1984\\r\\nstones were wet as though they had just been washed, and \\r\\nhe had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh \\r\\nand pale was the blue between the chimney-pots. Tireless\\x02ly the woman marched to and fro, corking and uncorking \\r\\nherself, singing and falling silent, and pegging out more di\\x02apers, and more and yet more. He wondered whether she \\r\\ntook in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twen\\x02ty or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side; \\r\\ntogether they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the \\r\\nsturdy figure below. As he looked at the woman in her char\\x02acteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching up for the line, \\r\\nher powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck him \\r\\nfor the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before \\r\\noccurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up \\r\\nto monstrous dimensions by childbearing, then hardened, \\r\\nroughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an \\r\\nover-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and after \\r\\nall, he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a \\r\\nblock of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same re\\x02lation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why \\r\\nshould the fruit be held inferior to the flower?\\r\\n‘She’s beautiful,’ he murmured.\\r\\n‘She’s a metre across the hips, easily,’ said Julia.\\r\\n‘That is her style of beauty,’ said Winston.\\r\\nHe held Julia’s supple waist easily encircled by his arm. \\r\\nFrom the hip to the knee her flank was against his. Out of \\r\\ntheir bodies no child would ever come. That was the one \\r\\nthing they could never do. Only by word of mouth, from \\r\\nmind to mind, could they pass on the secret. The woman \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 277\\r\\ndown there had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm \\r\\nheart, and a fertile belly. He wondered how many children \\r\\nshe had given birth to. It might easily be fifteen. She had \\r\\nhad her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps, of wild-rose \\r\\nbeauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized \\r\\nfruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life \\r\\nhad been laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweep\\x02ing, polishing, mending, scrubbing, laundering, first for \\r\\nchildren, then for grandchildren, over thirty unbroken \\r\\nyears. At the end of it she was still singing. The mystical \\r\\nreverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with \\r\\nthe aspect of the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind \\r\\nthe chimney-pots into interminable distance. It was curi\\x02ous to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in \\r\\nEurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under \\r\\nthe sky were also very much the same—everywhere, all over \\r\\nthe world, hundreds of thousands of millions of people just \\r\\nlike this, people ignorant of one another’s existence, held \\r\\napart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the \\r\\nsame—people who had never learned to think but who were \\r\\nstoring up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power \\r\\nthat would one day overturn the world. If there was hope, \\r\\nit lay in the proles! Without having read to the end of THE \\r\\nBOOK, he knew that that must be Goldstein’s final message. \\r\\nThe future belonged to the proles. And could he be sure that \\r\\nwhen their time came the world they constructed would not \\r\\nbe just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the \\r\\nParty? Yes, because at the least it would be a world of sanity. \\r\\nWhere there is equality there can be sanity. Sooner or later \\n278 1984\\r\\nit would happen, strength would change into consciousness. \\r\\nThe proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you \\r\\nlooked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end their \\r\\nawakening would come. And until that happened, though it \\r\\nmight be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all \\r\\nthe odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vital\\x02ity which the Party did not share and could not kill.\\r\\n‘Do you remember,’ he said, ‘the thrush that sang to us, \\r\\nthat first day, at the edge of the wood?’\\r\\n‘He wasn’t singing to us,’ said Julia. ‘He was singing to \\r\\nplease himself. Not even that. He was just singing.’\\r\\nThe birds sang, the proles sang. the Party did not sing. \\r\\nAll round the world, in London and New York, in Africa \\r\\nand Brazil, and in the mysterious, forbidden lands beyond \\r\\nthe frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin, in the villag\\x02es of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China and \\r\\nJapan—everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable \\r\\nfigure, made monstrous by work and childbearing, toiling \\r\\nfrom birth to death and still singing. Out of those mighty \\r\\nloins a race of conscious beings must one day come. You \\r\\nwere the dead, theirs was the future. But you could share in \\r\\nthat future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the \\r\\nbody, and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two \\r\\nmake four.\\r\\n‘We are the dead,’ he said.\\r\\n‘We are the dead,’ echoed Julia dutifully.\\r\\n‘You are the dead,’ said an iron voice behind them.\\r\\nThey sprang apart. Winston’s entrails seemed to have \\r\\nturned into ice. He could see the white all round the irises of \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 279\\r\\nJulia’s eyes. Her face had turned a milky yellow. The smear \\r\\nof rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharply, \\r\\nalmost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.\\r\\n‘You are the dead,’ repeated the iron voice.\\r\\n‘It was behind the picture,’ breathed Julia.\\r\\n‘It was behind the picture,’ said the voice. ‘Remain exactly \\r\\nwhere you are. Make no movement until you are ordered.’\\r\\nIt was starting, it was starting at last! They could do noth\\x02ing except stand gazing into one another’s eyes. To run for \\r\\nlife, to get out of the house before it was too late—no such \\r\\nthought occurred to them. Unthinkable to disobey the iron \\r\\nvoice from the wall. There was a snap as though a catch had \\r\\nbeen turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. The picture \\r\\nhad fallen to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it.\\r\\n‘Now they can see us,’ said Julia.\\r\\n‘Now we can see you,’ said the voice. ‘Stand out in the \\r\\nmiddle of the room. Stand back to back. Clasp your hands \\r\\nbehind your heads. Do not touch one another.’\\r\\nThey were not touching, but it seemed to him that he \\r\\ncould feel Julia’s body shaking. Or perhaps it was merely \\r\\nthe shaking of his own. He could just stop his teeth from \\r\\nchattering, but his knees were beyond his control. There \\r\\nwas a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and \\r\\noutside. The yard seemed to be full of men. Something was \\r\\nbeing dragged across the stones. The woman’s singing had \\r\\nstopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling clang, as though \\r\\nthe washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a con\\x02fusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.\\r\\n‘The house is surrounded,’ said Winston.\\n280 1984\\r\\n‘The house is surrounded,’ said the voice.\\r\\nHe heard Julia snap her teeth together. ‘I suppose we may \\r\\nas well say good-bye,’ she said.\\r\\n‘You may as well say good-bye,’ said the voice. And then \\r\\nanother quite different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which \\r\\nWinston had the impression of having heard before, struck \\r\\nin; ‘And by the way, while we are on the subject, ‘Here comes \\r\\na candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop \\r\\noff your head’!’\\r\\nSomething crashed on to the bed behind Winston’s back. \\r\\nThe head of a ladder had been thrust through the window \\r\\nand had burst in the frame. Someone was climbing through \\r\\nthe window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs. \\r\\nThe room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron\\x02shod boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands.\\r\\nWinston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he \\r\\nbarely moved. One thing alone mattered; to keep still, to \\r\\nkeep still and not give them an excuse to hit you! A man \\r\\nwith a smooth prize-fighter’s jowl in which the mouth was \\r\\nonly a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon \\r\\nmeditatively between thumb and forefinger. Winston met \\r\\nhis eyes. The feeling of nakedness, with one’s hands behind \\r\\none’s head and one’s face and body all exposed, was almost \\r\\nunbearable. The man protruded the tip of a white tongue, \\r\\nlicked the place where his lips should have been, and then \\r\\npassed on. There was another crash. Someone had picked \\r\\nup the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to \\r\\npieces on the hearth-stone.\\r\\nThe fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sug-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 281\\r\\nar rosebud from a cake, rolled across the mat. How small, \\r\\nthought Winston, how small it always was! There was a gasp \\r\\nand a thump behind him, and he received a violent kick on \\r\\nthe ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One of the \\r\\nmen had smashed his fist into Julia’s solar plexus, doubling \\r\\nher up like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the \\r\\nfloor, fighting for breath. Winston dared not turn his head \\r\\neven by a millimetre, but sometimes her livid, gasping face \\r\\ncame within the angle of his vision. Even in his terror it was \\r\\nas though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly \\r\\npain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to \\r\\nget back her breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible, \\r\\nagonizing pain which was there all the while but could not \\r\\nbe suffered yet, because before all else it was necessary to \\r\\nbe able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her up by \\r\\nknees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a \\r\\nsack. Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yel\\x02low and contorted, with the eyes shut, and still with a smear \\r\\nof rouge on either cheek; and that was the last he saw of \\r\\nher.\\r\\nHe stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts \\r\\nwhich came of their own accord but seemed totally uninter\\x02esting began to flit through his mind. He wondered whether \\r\\nthey had got Mr Charrington. He wondered what they had \\r\\ndone to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he bad\\x02ly wanted to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he \\r\\nhad done so only two or three hours ago. He noticed that \\r\\nthe clock on the mantelpiece said nine, meaning twenty\\x02one. But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light \\n282 1984\\r\\nbe fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening? He \\r\\nwondered whether after all he and Julia had mistaken the \\r\\ntime—had slept the clock round and thought it was twen\\x02ty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty on the \\r\\nfollowing morning. But he did not pursue the thought fur\\x02ther. It was not interesting.\\r\\nThere ws another, lighter step in the passage. Mr \\r\\nCharrington came into the room. The demeanour of \\r\\nthe black-uniformed men suddenly became more sub\\x02dued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington’s \\r\\nappearance. His eye fell on the fragments of the glass pa\\x02perweight.\\r\\n‘Pick up those pieces,’ he said sharply.\\r\\nA man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disap\\x02peared; Winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that \\r\\nhe had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen. Mr Char\\x02rington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but his hair, \\r\\nwhich had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was \\r\\nnot wearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp \\r\\nglance, as though verifying his identity, and then paid no \\r\\nmore attention to him. He was still recognizable, but he was \\r\\nnot the same person any longer. His body had straightened, \\r\\nand seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergone \\r\\nonly tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete \\r\\ntransformation. The black eyebrows were less bushy, the \\r\\nwrinkles were gone, the whole lines of the face seemed to \\r\\nhave altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It was the alert, \\r\\ncold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It occurred to \\r\\nWinston that for the first time in his life he was looking, \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 283\\r\\nwith knowledge, at a member of the Thought Police.\\n284 1984\\r\\nPart Three\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 285\\r\\nChapter 1\\r\\nHe did not know where he was. Presumably he was in \\r\\nthe Ministry of Love, but there was no way of mak\\x02ing certain. He was in a high-ceilinged windowless cell with \\r\\nwalls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps flood\\x02ed it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming \\r\\nsound which he supposed had something to do with the \\r\\nair supply. A bench, or shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran \\r\\nround the wall, broken only by the door and, at the end op\\x02posite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden seat. There \\r\\nwere four telescreens, one in each wall.\\r\\nThere was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there \\r\\never since they had bundled him into the closed van and \\r\\ndriven him away. But he was also hungry, with a gnaw\\x02ing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four \\r\\nhours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did \\r\\nnot know, probably never would know, whether it had been \\r\\nmorning or evening when they arrested him. Since he was \\r\\narrested he had not been fed.\\r\\nHe sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his \\r\\nhands crossed on his knee. He had already learned to sit \\r\\nstill. If you made unexpected movements they yelled at you \\r\\nfrom the telescreen. But the craving for food was growing \\r\\nupon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread. \\r\\nHe had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the \\n286 1984\\r\\npocket of his overalls. It was even possible—he thought this \\r\\nbecause from time to time something seemed to tickle his \\r\\nleg—that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there. In the \\r\\nend the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he slipped \\r\\na hand into his pocket.\\r\\n‘Smith!’ yelled a voice from the telescreen. ‘6079 Smith \\r\\nW.! Hands out of pockets in the cells!’\\r\\nHe sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Be\\x02fore being brought here he had been taken to another place \\r\\nwhich must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary \\r\\nlock-up used by the patrols. He did not know how long he \\r\\nhad been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and \\r\\nno daylight it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil\\x02smelling place. They had put him into a cell similar to the \\r\\none he was now in, but filthily dirty and at all times crowded \\r\\nby ten or fifteen people. The majority of them were common \\r\\ncriminals, but there were a few political prisoners among \\r\\nthem. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirty \\r\\nbodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to \\r\\ntake much interest in his surroundings, but still noticing \\r\\nthe astonishing difference in demeanour between the Party \\r\\nprisoners and the others. The Party prisoners were always \\r\\nsilent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals seemed to \\r\\ncare nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards, \\r\\nfought back fiercely when their belongings were impound\\x02ed, wrote obscene words on the floor, ate smuggled food \\r\\nwhich they produced from mysterious hiding-places in their \\r\\nclothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when it tried \\r\\nto restore order. On the other hand some of them seemed \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 287\\r\\nto be on good terms with the guards, called them by nick\\x02names, and tried to wheedle cigarettes through the spyhole \\r\\nin the door. The guards, too, treated the common criminals \\r\\nwith a certain forbearance, even when they had to handle \\r\\nthem roughly. There was much talk about the forced-labour \\r\\ncamps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent. \\r\\nIt was ‘all right’ in the camps, he gathered, so long as you \\r\\nhad good contacts and knew the ropes. There was bribery, \\r\\nfavouritism, and racketeering of every kind, there was ho\\x02mosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit alcohol \\r\\ndistilled from potatoes. The positions of trust were given \\r\\nonly to the common criminals, especially the gangsters and \\r\\nthe murderers, who formed a sort of aristocracy. All the \\r\\ndirty jobs were done by the politicals.\\r\\nThere was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every \\r\\ndescription: drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-mar\\x02keteers, drunks, prostitutes. Some of the drunks were so \\r\\nviolent that the other prisoners had to combine to sup\\x02press them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged about \\r\\nsixty, with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white \\r\\nhair which had come down in her struggles, was carried in, \\r\\nkicking and shouting, by four guards, who had hold of her \\r\\none at each corner. They wrenched off the boots with which \\r\\nshe had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down \\r\\nacross Winston’s lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones. The \\r\\nwoman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with \\r\\na yell of ‘F—— bastards!’ Then, noticing that she was sit\\x02ting on something uneven, she slid off Winston’s knees on \\r\\nto the bench.\\n288 1984\\r\\n‘Beg pardon, dearie,’ she said. ‘I wouldn’t ‘a sat on you, \\r\\nonly the buggers put me there. They dono ‘ow to treat a lady, \\r\\ndo they?’ She paused, patted her breast, and belched. ‘Par\\x02don,’ she said, ‘I ain’t meself, quite.’\\r\\nShe leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor.\\r\\n‘Thass better,’ she said, leaning back with closed eyes. \\r\\n‘Never keep it down, thass what I say. Get it up while it’s \\r\\nfresh on your stomach, like.’\\r\\nShe revived, turned to have another look at Winston and \\r\\nseemed immediately to take a fancy to him. She put a vast \\r\\narm round his shoulder and drew him towards her, breath\\x02ing beer and vomit into his face.\\r\\n‘Wass your name, dearie?’ she said.\\r\\n‘Smith,’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘Smith?’ said the woman. ‘Thass funny. My name’s Smith \\r\\ntoo. Why,’ she added sentimentally, ‘I might be your moth\\x02er!’\\r\\nShe might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was \\r\\nabout the right age and physique, and it was probable that \\r\\npeople changed somewhat after twenty years in a forced-la\\x02bour camp.\\r\\nNo one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent \\r\\nthe ordinary criminals ignored the Party prisoners. ‘The \\r\\npolITS,’ they called them, with a sort of uninterested con\\x02tempt. The Party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking to \\r\\nanybody, and above all of speaking to one another. Only \\r\\nonce, when two Party members, both women, were pressed \\r\\nclose together on the bench, he overheard amid the din of \\r\\nvoices a few hurriedly-whispered words; and in particular a \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 289\\r\\nreference to something called ‘room one-oh-one’, which he \\r\\ndid not understand.\\r\\nIt might be two or three hours ago that they had brought \\r\\nhim here. The dull pain in his belly never went away, but \\r\\nsometimes it grew better and sometimes worse, and his \\r\\nthoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. When it \\r\\ngrew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his de\\x02sire for food. When it grew better, panic took hold of him. \\r\\nThere were moments when he foresaw the things that would \\r\\nhappen to him with such actuality that his heart galloped \\r\\nand his breath stopped. He felt the smash of truncheons on \\r\\nhis elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself \\r\\ngrovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through bro\\x02ken teeth. He hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his \\r\\nmind on her. He loved her and would not betray her; but \\r\\nthat was only a fact, known as he knew the rules of arith\\x02metic. He felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered \\r\\nwhat was happening to her. He thought oftener of O’Brien, \\r\\nwith a flickering hope. O’Brien might know that he had \\r\\nbeen arrested. The Brotherhood, he had said, never tried to \\r\\nsave its members. But there was the razor blade; they would \\r\\nsend the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps \\r\\nfive seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The \\r\\nblade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness, \\r\\nand even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone. \\r\\nEverything came back to his sick body, which shrank trem\\x02bling from the smallest pain. He was not certain that he \\r\\nwould use the razor blade even if he got the chance. It was \\r\\nmore natural to exist from moment to moment, accepting \\n290 1984\\r\\nanother ten minutes’ life even with the certainty that there \\r\\nwas torture at the end of it.\\r\\nSometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain \\r\\nbricks in the walls of the cell. It should have been easy, but \\r\\nhe always lost count at some point or another. More often he \\r\\nwondered where he was, and what time of day it was. At one \\r\\nmoment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside, \\r\\nand at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In \\r\\nthis place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be \\r\\nturned out. It was the place with no darkness: he saw now \\r\\nwhy O’Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion. In the \\r\\nMinistry of Love there were no windows. His cell might be \\r\\nat the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it might \\r\\nbe ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved \\r\\nhimself mentally from place to place, and tried to deter\\x02mine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched \\r\\nhigh in the air or buried deep underground.\\r\\nThere was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel \\r\\ndoor opened with a clang. A young officer, a trim black-uni\\x02formed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished \\r\\nleather, and whose pale, straight-featured face was like a \\r\\nwax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He mo\\x02tioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they \\r\\nwere leading. The poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. \\r\\nThe door clanged shut again.\\r\\nAmpleforth made one or two uncertain movements from \\r\\nside to side, as though having some idea that there was an\\x02other door to go out of, and then began to wander up and \\r\\ndown the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston’s presence. \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 291\\r\\nHis troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre \\r\\nabove the level of Winston’s head. He was shoeless; large, \\r\\ndirty toes were sticking out of the holes in his socks. He \\r\\nwas also several days away from a shave. A scrubby beard \\r\\ncovered his face to the cheekbones, giving him an air of \\r\\nruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame and \\r\\nnervous movements.\\r\\nWinston roused hirnself a little from his lethargy. He \\r\\nmust speak to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the tele\\x02screen. It was even conceivable that Ampleforth was the \\r\\nbearer of the razor blade.\\r\\n‘Ampleforth,’ he said.\\r\\nThere was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth \\r\\npaused, mildly startled. His eyes focused themselves slowly \\r\\non Winston.\\r\\n‘Ah, Smith!’ he said. ‘You too!’\\r\\n‘What are you in for?’\\r\\n‘To tell you the truth—’ He sat down awkwardly on the \\r\\nbench opposite Winston. ‘There is only one offence, is there \\r\\nnot?’ he said.\\r\\n‘And have you committed it?’\\r\\n‘Apparently I have.’\\r\\nHe put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for \\r\\na moment, as though trying to remember something.\\r\\n‘These things happen,’ he began vaguely. ‘I have been \\r\\nable to recall one instance—a possible instance. It was an \\r\\nindiscretion, undoubtedly. We were producing a definitive \\r\\nedition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the word ‘God’ to \\r\\nremain at the end of a line. I could not help it!’ he added al-\\n292 1984\\r\\nmost indignantly, raising his face to look at Winston. ‘It was \\r\\nimpossible to change the line. The rhyme was ‘rod”. Do you \\r\\nrealize that there are only twelve rhymes to ‘rod’ in the en\\x02tire language? For days I had racked my brains. There WAS \\r\\nno other rhyme.’\\r\\nThe expression on his face changed. The annoyance \\r\\npassed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased. \\r\\nA sort of intellectual warmth, the joy of the pedant who has \\r\\nfound out some useless fact, shone through the dirt and \\r\\nscrubby hair.\\r\\n‘Has it ever occurred to you,’ he said, ‘that the whole his\\x02tory of English poetry has been determined by the fact that \\r\\nthe English language lacks rhymes?’\\r\\nNo, that particular thought had never occurred to Win\\x02ston. Nor, in the circumstances, did it strike him as very \\r\\nimportant or interesting.\\r\\n‘Do you know what time of day it is?’ he said.\\r\\nAmpleforth looked startled again. ‘I had hardly thought \\r\\nabout it. They arrested me—it could be two days ago—per\\x02haps three.’ His eyes flitted round the walls, as though he \\r\\nhalf expected to find a window somewhere. ‘There is no dif\\x02ference between night and day in this place. I do not see \\r\\nhow one can calculate the time.’\\r\\nThey talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without \\r\\napparent reason, a yell from the telescreen bade them be \\r\\nsilent. Winston sat quietly, his hands crossed. Ampleforth, \\r\\ntoo large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench, fidgeted \\r\\nfrom side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one \\r\\nknee, then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 293\\r\\nkeep still. Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour—it was \\r\\ndifficult to judge. Once more there was a sound of boots \\r\\noutside. Winston’s entrails contracted. Soon, very soon, \\r\\nperhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots \\r\\nwould mean that his own turn had come.\\r\\nThe door opened. The cold-faced young officer stepped \\r\\ninto the cell. With a brief movement of the hand he indi\\x02cated Ampleforth.\\r\\n‘Room 101,’ he said.\\r\\nAmpleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, \\r\\nhis face vaguely perturbed, but uncomprehending.\\r\\nWhat seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Win\\x02ston’s belly had revived. His mind sagged round and round \\r\\non the same trick, like a ball falling again and again into \\r\\nthe same series of slots. He had only six thoughts. The pain \\r\\nin his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the screaming; \\r\\nO’Brien; Julia; the razor blade. There was another spasm in \\r\\nhis entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. As the door \\r\\nopened, the wave of air that it created brought in a power\\x02ful smell of cold sweat. Parsons walked into the cell. He was \\r\\nwearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.\\r\\nThis time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.\\r\\n‘YOU here!’ he said.\\r\\nParsons gave Winston a glance in which there was \\r\\nneither interest nor surprise, but only misery. He began \\r\\nwalking jerkily up and down, evidently unable to keep still. \\r\\nEach time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent \\r\\nthat they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring \\r\\nlook, as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at \\n294 1984\\r\\nsomething in the middle distance.\\r\\n‘What are you in for?’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘Thoughtcrime!’ said Parsons, almost blubbering. The \\r\\ntone of his voice implied at once a complete admission of \\r\\nhis guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word \\r\\ncould be applied to himself. He paused opposite Winston \\r\\nand began eagerly appealing to him: ‘You don’t think they’ll \\r\\nshoot me, do you, old chap? They don’t shoot you if you \\r\\nhaven’t actually done anything—only thoughts, which you \\r\\ncan’t help? I know they give you a fair hearing. Oh, I trust \\r\\nthem for that! They’ll know my record, won’t they? YOU \\r\\nknow what kind of chap I was. Not a bad chap in my way. \\r\\nNot brainy, of course, but keen. I tried to do my best for the \\r\\nParty, didn’t I? I’ll get off with five years, don’t you think? Or \\r\\neven ten years? A chap like me could make himself pretty \\r\\nuseful in a labour-camp. They wouldn’t shoot me for going \\r\\noff the rails just once?’\\r\\n‘Are you guilty?’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘Of course I’m guilty!’ cried Parsons with a servile glance \\r\\nat the telescreen. ‘You don’t think the Party would arrest \\r\\nan innocent man, do you?’ His frog-like face grew calm\\x02er, and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression. \\r\\n‘Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,’ he said senten\\x02tiously. ‘It’s insidious. It can get hold of you without your \\r\\neven knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my \\r\\nsleep! Yes, that’s a fact. There I was, working away, trying to \\r\\ndo my bit—never knew I had any bad stuff in my mind at all. \\r\\nAnd then I started talking in my sleep. Do you know what \\r\\nthey heard me saying?’\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 295\\r\\nHe sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medi\\x02cal reasons to utter an obscenity.\\r\\n‘’Down with Big Brother!’ Yes, I said that! Said it over \\r\\nand over again, it seems. Between you and me, old man, I’m \\r\\nglad they got me before it went any further. Do you know \\r\\nwhat I’m going to say to them when I go up before the tribu\\x02nal? ‘Thank you,’ I’m going to say, ‘thank you for saving me \\r\\nbefore it was too late.‘‘\\r\\n‘Who denounced you?’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘It was my little daughter,’ said Parsons with a sort of \\r\\ndoleful pride. ‘She listened at the keyhole. Heard what I \\r\\nwas saying, and nipped off to the patrols the very next day. \\r\\nPretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh? I don’t bear her any \\r\\ngrudge for it. In fact I’m proud of her. It shows I brought her \\r\\nup in the right spirit, anyway.’\\r\\nHe made a few more jerky movements up and down, \\r\\nseveral times, casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan. \\r\\nThen he suddenly ripped down his shorts.\\r\\n‘Excuse me, old man,’ he said. ‘I can’t help it. It’s the wait\\x02ing.’\\r\\nHe plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan. \\r\\nWinston covered his face with his hands.\\r\\n‘Smith!’ yelled the voice from the telescreen. ‘6079 Smith \\r\\nW! Uncover your face. No faces covered in the cells.’\\r\\nWinston uncovered his face. Parsons used the lavatory, \\r\\nloudly and abundantly. It then turned out that the plug was \\r\\ndefective and the cell stank abominably for hours after\\x02wards.\\r\\nParsons was removed. More prisoners came and went, \\n296 1984\\r\\nmysteriously. One, a woman, was consigned to ‘Room 101’, \\r\\nand, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel and turn a differ\\x02ent colour when she heard the words. A time came when, if \\r\\nit had been morning when he was brought here, it would be \\r\\nafternoon; or if it had been afternoon, then it would be mid\\x02night. There were six prisoners in the cell, men and women. \\r\\nAll sat very still. Opposite Winston there sat a man with a \\r\\nchinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large, harm\\x02less rodent. His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the \\r\\nbottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had little \\r\\nstores of food tucked away there. His pale-grey eyes flitted \\r\\ntimorously from face to face and turned quickly away again \\r\\nwhen he caught anyone’s eye.\\r\\nThe door opened, and another prisoner was brought in \\r\\nwhose appearance sent a momentary chill through Win\\x02ston. He was a commonplace, mean-looking man who \\r\\nmight have been an engineer or technician of some kind. \\r\\nBut what was startling was the emaciation of his face. It \\r\\nwas like a skull. Because of its thinness the mouth and eyes \\r\\nlooked disproportionately large, and the eyes seemed filled \\r\\nwith a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or \\r\\nsomething.\\r\\nThe man sat down on the bench at a little distance from \\r\\nWinston. Winston did not look at him again, but the tor\\x02mented, skull-like face was as vivid in his mind as though \\r\\nit had been straight in front of his eyes. Suddenly he real\\x02ized what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation. \\r\\nThe same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously \\r\\nto everyone in the cell. There was a very faint stirring all \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 297\\r\\nthe way round the bench. The eyes of the chinless man kept \\r\\nflitting towards the skull-faced man, then turning guiltily \\r\\naway, then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction. \\r\\nPresently he began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood up, \\r\\nwaddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket \\r\\nof his overalls, and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy \\r\\npiece of bread to the skull-faced man.\\r\\nThere was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen. \\r\\nThe chinless man jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man \\r\\nhad quickly thrust his hands behind his back, as though \\r\\ndemonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift.\\r\\n‘Bumstead!’ roared the voice. ‘2713 Bumstead J.! Let fall \\r\\nthat piece of bread!’\\r\\nThe chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the \\r\\nfloor.\\r\\n‘Remain standing where you are,’ said the voice. ‘Face the \\r\\ndoor. Make no movement.’\\r\\nThe chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy cheeks were \\r\\nquivering uncontrollably. The door clanged open. As the \\r\\nyoung officer entered and stepped aside, there emerged \\r\\nfrom behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous \\r\\narms and shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chin\\x02less man, and then, at a signal from the officer, let free a \\r\\nfrightful blow, with all the weight of his body behind it, full \\r\\nin the chinless man’s mouth. The force of it seemed almost \\r\\nto knock him clear of the floor. His body was flung across \\r\\nthe cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat. \\r\\nFor a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood \\r\\noozing from his mouth and nose. A very faint whimper-\\n298 1984\\r\\ning or squeaking, which seemed unconscious, came out of \\r\\nhim. Then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily on \\r\\nhands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the \\r\\ntwo halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.\\r\\nThe prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their \\r\\nknees. The chinless man climbed back into his place. Down \\r\\none side of his face the flesh was darkening. His mouth had \\r\\nswollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured mass with a black \\r\\nhole in the middle of it.\\r\\nFrom time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast \\r\\nof his overalls. His grey eyes still flitted from face to face, \\r\\nmore guiltily than ever, as though he were trying to discov\\x02er how much the others despised him for his humiliation.\\r\\nThe door opened. With a small gesture the officer indi\\x02cated the skull-faced man.\\r\\n‘Room 101,’ he said.\\r\\nThere was a gasp and a flurry at Winston’s side. The man \\r\\nhad actually flung himself on his knees on the floor, with \\r\\nhis hand clasped together.\\r\\n‘Comrade! Officer!’ he cried. ‘You don’t have to take me to \\r\\nthat place! Haven’t I told you everything already? What else \\r\\nis it you want to know? There’s nothing I wouldn’t confess, \\r\\nnothing! Just tell me what it is and I’ll confess straight off. \\r\\nWrite it down and I’ll sign it—anything! Not room 101!’\\r\\n‘Room 101,’ said the officer.\\r\\nThe man’s face, already very pale, turned a colour Win\\x02ston would not have believed possible. It was definitely, \\r\\nunmistakably, a shade of green.\\r\\n‘Do anything to me!’ he yelled. ‘You’ve been starving me \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 299\\r\\nfor weeks. Finish it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. \\r\\nSentence me to twenty-five years. Is there somebody else \\r\\nyou want me to give away? Just say who it is and I’ll tell you \\r\\nanything you want. I don’t care who it is or what you do to \\r\\nthem. I’ve got a wife and three children. The biggest of them \\r\\nisn’t six years old. You can take the whole lot of them and \\r\\ncut their throats in front of my eyes, and I’ll stand by and \\r\\nwatch it. But not Room 101!’\\r\\n‘Room 101,’ said the officer.\\r\\nThe man looked frantically round at the other prisoners, \\r\\nas though with some idea that he could put another victim \\r\\nin his own place. His eyes settled on the smashed face of the \\r\\nchinless man. He flung out a lean arm.\\r\\n‘That’s the one you ought to be taking, not me!’ he shout\\x02ed. ‘You didn’t hear what he was saying after they bashed \\r\\nhis face. Give me a chance and I’ll tell you every word of it. \\r\\nHE’S the one that’s against the Party, not me.’ The guards \\r\\nstepped forward. The man’s voice rose to a shriek. ‘You \\r\\ndidn’t hear him!’ he repeated. ‘Something went wrong with \\r\\nthe telescreen. HE’S the one you want. Take him, not me!’\\r\\nThe two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the \\r\\narms. But just at this moment he flung himself across the \\r\\nfloor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that sup\\x02ported the bench. He had set up a wordless howling, like an \\r\\nanimal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose, \\r\\nbut he clung on with astonishing strength. For perhaps \\r\\ntwenty seconds they were hauling at him. The prisoners sat \\r\\nquiet, their hands crossed on their knees, looking straight \\r\\nin front of them. The howling stopped; the man had no \\n300 1984\\r\\nbreath left for anything except hanging on. Then there was \\r\\na different kind of cry. A kick from a guard’s boot had bro\\x02ken the fingers of one of his hands. They dragged him to \\r\\nhis feet.\\r\\n‘Room 101,’ said the officer.\\r\\nThe man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head \\r\\nsunken, nursing his crushed hand, all the fight had gone \\r\\nout of him.\\r\\nA long time passed. If it had been midnight when the \\r\\nskull-faced man was taken away, it was morning: if morn\\x02ing, it was afternoon. Winston was alone, and had been \\r\\nalone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow bench \\r\\nwas such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved \\r\\nby the telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chin\\x02less man had dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard \\r\\neffort not to look at it, but presently hunger gave way to \\r\\nthirst. His mouth was sticky and evil-tasting. The hum\\x02ming sound and the unvarying white light induced a sort \\r\\nof faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would get \\r\\nup because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, \\r\\nand then would sit down again almost at once because he \\r\\nwas too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet. Whenever \\r\\nhis physical sensations were a little under control the ter\\x02ror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of \\r\\nO’Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor \\r\\nblade might arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever \\r\\nfed. More dimly he thought of Julia. Somewhere or other \\r\\nshe was suffering perhaps far worse than he. She might be \\r\\nscreaming with pain at this moment. He thought: ‘If I could \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 301\\r\\nsave Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I \\r\\nwould.’ But that was merely an intellectual decision, taken \\r\\nbecause he knew that he ought to take it. He did not feel it. \\r\\nIn this place you could not feel anything, except pain and \\r\\nforeknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible, when you \\r\\nwere actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your \\r\\nown pain should increase? But that question was not an\\x02swerable yet.\\r\\nThe boots were approaching again. The door opened. \\r\\nO’Brien came in.\\r\\nWinston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had \\r\\ndriven all caution out of him. For the first time in many \\r\\nyears he forgot the presence of the telescreen.\\r\\n‘They’ve got you too!’ he cried.\\r\\n‘They got me a long time ago,’ said O’Brien with a mild, \\r\\nalmost regretful irony. He stepped aside. From behind him \\r\\nthere emerged a broad-chested guard with a long black \\r\\ntruncheon in his hand.\\r\\n‘You know this, Winston,’ said O’Brien. ‘Don’t deceive \\r\\nyourself. You did know it—you have always known it.’\\r\\nYes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no \\r\\ntime to think of that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon \\r\\nin the guard’s hand. It might fall anywhere; on the crown, \\r\\non the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on the elbow——\\r\\nThe elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost para\\x02lysed, clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand. \\r\\nEverything had exploded into yellow light. Inconceivable, \\r\\ninconceivable that one blow could cause such pain! The \\r\\nlight cleared and he could see the other two looking down \\n302 1984\\r\\nat him. The guard was laughing at his contortions. One \\r\\nquestion at any rate was answered. Never, for any reason \\r\\non earth, could you wish for an increase of pain. Of pain \\r\\nyou could wish only one thing: that it should stop. Nothing \\r\\nin the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain \\r\\nthere are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as \\r\\nhe writhed on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled \\r\\nleft arm.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 303\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\nHe was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, ex\\x02cept that it was higher off the ground and that he was \\r\\nfixed down in some way so that he could not move. Light \\r\\nthat seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face. \\r\\nO’Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him in\\x02tently. At the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, \\r\\nholding a hypodermic syringe.\\r\\nEven after his eyes were open he took in his surround\\x02ings only gradually. He had the impression of swimming up \\r\\ninto this room from some quite different world, a sort of un\\x02derwater world far beneath it. How long he had been down \\r\\nthere he did not know. Since the moment when they arrest\\x02ed him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his \\r\\nmemories were not continuous. There had been times when \\r\\nconsciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one has \\r\\nin sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blank \\r\\ninterval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks or \\r\\nonly seconds, there was no way of knowing.\\r\\nWith that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had \\r\\nstarted. Later he was to realize that all that then happened \\r\\nwas merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation to which \\r\\nnearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a long range \\r\\nof crimes—espionage, sabotage, and the like—to which ev\\x02eryone had to confess as a matter of course. The confession \\n304 1984\\r\\nwas a formality, though the torture was real. How many \\r\\ntimes he had been beaten, how long the beatings had con\\x02tinued, he could not remember. Always there were five or \\r\\nsix men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Some\\x02times it was fists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimes \\r\\nit was steel rods, sometimes it was boots. There were times \\r\\nwhen he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal, \\r\\nwrithing his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless \\r\\neffort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet \\r\\nmore kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his \\r\\nshins, in his groin, in his testicles, on the bone at the base \\r\\nof his spine. There were times when it went on and on un\\x02til the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not \\r\\nthat the guards continued to beat him but that he could not \\r\\nforce hirnself into losing consciousness. There were times \\r\\nwhen his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for \\r\\nmercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight \\r\\nof a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him \\r\\npour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There \\r\\nwere other times when he started out with the resolve of \\r\\nconfessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out \\r\\nof him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he \\r\\nfeebly tried to compromise, when he said to himself: ‘I will \\r\\nconfess, but not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomes \\r\\nunbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I \\r\\nwill tell them what they want.’ Sometimes he was beaten till \\r\\nhe could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on \\r\\nto the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate for a few hours, \\r\\nand then taken out and beaten again. There were also longer \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 305\\r\\nperiods of recovery. He remembered them dimly, because \\r\\nthey were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor. He remembered \\r\\na cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the \\r\\nwall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread \\r\\nand sometimes coffee. He remembered a surly barber arriv\\x02ing to scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike, \\r\\nunsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tapping \\r\\nhis reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers \\r\\nover him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles \\r\\ninto his arm to make him sleep.\\r\\nThe beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a \\r\\nthreat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any mo\\x02ment when his answers were unsatisfactory. His questioners \\r\\nnow were not ruffians in black uniforms but Party intellec\\x02tuals, little rotund men with quick movements and flashing \\r\\nspectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which \\r\\nlasted—he thought, he could not be sure—ten or twelve \\r\\nhours at a stretch. These other questioners saw to it that he \\r\\nwas in constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain that \\r\\nthey relied on. They slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulled \\r\\nhis hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to \\r\\nurinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran \\r\\nwith water; but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him \\r\\nand destroy his power of arguing and reasoning. Their real \\r\\nweapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on, \\r\\nhour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for him, twist\\x02ing everything that he said, convicting him at every step of \\r\\nlies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much \\r\\nfrom shame as from nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would \\n306 1984\\r\\nweep half a dozen times in a single session. Most of the time \\r\\nthey screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesita\\x02tion to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes \\r\\nthey would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, \\r\\nappeal to him in the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and \\r\\nask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough \\r\\nloyalty to the Party left to make him wish to undo the evil \\r\\nhe had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours of \\r\\nquestioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivel\\x02ling tears. In the end the nagging voices broke him down \\r\\nmore completely than the boots and fists of the guards. He \\r\\nbecame simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed, \\r\\nwhatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was to \\r\\nfind out what they wanted him to confess, and then confess \\r\\nit quickly, before the bullying started anew. He confessed \\r\\nto the assassination of eminent Party members, the dis\\x02tribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public \\r\\nfunds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He \\r\\nconfessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the Easta\\x02sian government as far back as 1968. He confessed that he \\r\\nwas a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sex\\x02ual pervert. He confessed that he had murdered his wife, \\r\\nalthough he knew, and his questioners must have known, \\r\\nthat his wife was still alive. He confessed that for years he \\r\\nhad been in personal touch with Goldstein and had been \\r\\na member of an underground organization which had in\\x02cluded almost every human being he had ever known. It \\r\\nwas easier to confess everything and implicate everybody. \\r\\nBesides, in a sense it was all true. It was true that he had \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 307\\r\\nbeen the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes of the Party \\r\\nthere was no distinction between the thought and the deed.\\r\\nThere were also memories of another kind. They stood \\r\\nout in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with black\\x02ness all round them.\\r\\nHe was in a cell which might have been either dark or \\r\\nlight, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes. \\r\\nNear at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slow\\x02ly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more luminous. \\r\\nSuddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and \\r\\nwas swallowed up.\\r\\nHe was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under \\r\\ndazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading the dials. \\r\\nThere was a tramp of heavy boots outside. The door clanged \\r\\nopen. The waxed-faced officer marched in, followed by two \\r\\nguards.\\r\\n‘Room 101,’ said the officer.\\r\\nThe man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not \\r\\nlook at Winston either; he was looking only at the dials.\\r\\nHe was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre \\r\\nwide, full of glorious, golden light, roaring with laughter \\r\\nand shouting out confessions at the top of his voice. He was \\r\\nconfessing everything, even the things he had succeeded \\r\\nin holding back under the torture. He was relating the en\\x02tire history of his life to an audience who knew it already. \\r\\nWith him were the guards, the other questioners, the men \\r\\nin white coats, O’Brien, Julia, Mr Charrington, all rolling \\r\\ndown the corridor together and shouting with laughter. \\r\\nSome dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the fu-\\n308 1984\\r\\nture had somehow been skipped over and had not happened. \\r\\nEverything was all right, there was no more pain, the last \\r\\ndetail of his life was laid bare, understood, forgiven.\\r\\nHe was starting up from the plank bed in the half-cer\\x02tainty that he had heard O’Brien’s voice. All through his \\r\\ninterrogation, although he had never seen him, he had had \\r\\nthe feeling that O’Brien was at his elbow, just out of sight. It \\r\\nwas O’Brien who was directing everything. It was he who \\r\\nset the guards on to Winston and who prevented them from \\r\\nkilling him. It was he who decided when Winston should \\r\\nscream with pain, when he should have a respite, when he \\r\\nshould be fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs should \\r\\nbe pumped into his arm. It was he who asked the ques\\x02tions and suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he \\r\\nwas the protector, he was the inquisitor, he was the friend. \\r\\nAnd once—Winston could not remember whether it was \\r\\nin drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment \\r\\nof wakefulness—a voice murmured in his ear: ‘Don’t wor\\x02ry, Winston; you are in my keeping. For seven years I have \\r\\nwatched over you. Now the turning-point has come. I shall \\r\\nsave you, I shall make you perfect.’ He was not sure whether \\r\\nit was O’Brien’s voice; but it was the same voice that had \\r\\nsaid to him, ‘We shall meet in the place where there is no \\r\\ndarkness,’ in that other dream, seven years ago.\\r\\nHe did not remember any ending to his interrogation. \\r\\nThere was a period of blackness and then the cell, or room, \\r\\nin which he now was had gradually materialized round him. \\r\\nHe was almost flat on his back, and unable to move. His \\r\\nbody was held down at every essential point. Even the back \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 309\\r\\nof his head was gripped in some manner. O’Brien was look\\x02ing down at him gravely and rather sadly. His face, seen \\r\\nfrom below, looked coarse and worn, with pouches under \\r\\nthe eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older \\r\\nthan Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight \\r\\nor fifty. Under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top \\r\\nand figures running round the face.\\r\\n‘I told you,’ said O’Brien, ‘that if we met again it would \\r\\nbe here.’\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said Winston.\\r\\nWithout any warning except a slight movement of \\r\\nO’Brien’s hand, a wave of pain flooded his body. It was a \\r\\nfrightening pain, because he could not see what was hap\\x02pening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was \\r\\nbeing done to him. He did not know whether the thing was \\r\\nreally happening, or whether the effect was electrically pro\\x02duced; but his body was being wrenched out of shape, the \\r\\njoints were being slowly torn apart. Although the pain had \\r\\nbrought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was \\r\\nthe fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his \\r\\nteeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep \\r\\nsilent as long as possible.\\r\\n‘You are afraid,’ said O’Brien, watching his face, ‘that in \\r\\nanother moment something is going to break. Your especial \\r\\nfear is that it will be your backbone. You have a vivid mental \\r\\npicture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid \\r\\ndripping out of them. That is what you are thinking, is it \\r\\nnot, Winston?’\\r\\nWinston did not answer. O’Brien drew back the lever on \\n310 1984\\r\\nthe dial. The wave of pain receded almost as quickly as it \\r\\nhad come.\\r\\n‘That was forty,’ said O’Brien. ‘You can see that the num\\x02bers on this dial run up to a hundred. Will you please \\r\\nremember, throughout our conversation, that I have it in \\r\\nmy power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to what\\x02ever degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt to \\r\\nprevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual level \\r\\nof intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you \\r\\nunderstand that?’\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said Winston.\\r\\nO’Brien’s manner became less severe. He resettled his \\r\\nspectacles thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and \\r\\ndown. When he spoke his voice was gentle and patient. He \\r\\nhad the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a priest, anxious to \\r\\nexplain and persuade rather than to punish.\\r\\n‘I am taking trouble with you, Winston,’ he said, ‘because \\r\\nyou are worth trouble. You know perfectly well what is the \\r\\nmatter with you. You have known it for years, though you \\r\\nhave fought against the knowledge. You are mentally de\\x02ranged. You suffer from a defective memory. You are unable \\r\\nto remember real events and you persuade yourself that you \\r\\nremember other events which never happened. Fortunately \\r\\nit is curable. You have never cured yourself of it, because \\r\\nyou did not choose to. There was a small effort of the will \\r\\nthat you were not ready to make. Even now, I am well aware, \\r\\nyou are clinging to your disease under the impression that \\r\\nit is a virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment, \\r\\nwhich power is Oceania at war with?’\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 311\\r\\n‘When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.’\\r\\n‘With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been at \\r\\nwar with Eastasia, has it not?’\\r\\nWinston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to \\r\\nspeak and then did not speak. He could not take his eyes \\r\\naway from the dial.\\r\\n‘The truth, please, Winston. YOUR truth. Tell me what \\r\\nyou think you remember.’\\r\\n‘I remember that until only a week before I was arrested, \\r\\nwe were not at war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance \\r\\nwith them. The war was against Eurasia. That had lasted for \\r\\nfour years. Before that——’\\r\\nO’Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.\\r\\n‘Another example,’ he said. ‘Some years ago you had a \\r\\nvery serious delusion indeed. You believed that three men, \\r\\nthree one-time Party members named Jones, Aaronson, \\r\\nand Rutherford—men who were executed for treachery \\r\\nand sabotage after making the fullest possible confession—\\r\\nwere not guilty of the crimes they were charged with. You \\r\\nbelieved that you had seen unmistakable documentary evi\\x02dence proving that their confessions were false. There was \\r\\na certain photograph about which you had a hallucination. \\r\\nYou believed that you had actually held it in your hands. It \\r\\nwas a photograph something like this.’\\r\\nAn oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between \\r\\nO’Brien’s fingers. For perhaps five seconds it was within the \\r\\nangle of Winston’s vision. It was a photograph, and there \\r\\nwas no question of its identity. It was THE photograph. It \\r\\nwas another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, \\n312 1984\\r\\nand Rutherford at the party function in New York, which \\r\\nhe had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly de\\x02stroyed. For only an instant it was before his eyes, then it \\r\\nwas out of sight again. But he had seen it, unquestionably he \\r\\nhad seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench \\r\\nthe top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so \\r\\nmuch as a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he \\r\\nhad even forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to hold the \\r\\nphotograph in his fingers again, or at least to see it.\\r\\n‘It exists!’ he cried.\\r\\n‘No,’ said O’Brien.\\r\\nHe stepped across the room. There was a memory hole \\r\\nin the opposite wall. O’Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the \\r\\nfrail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm \\r\\nair; it was vanishing in a flash of flame. O’Brien turned away \\r\\nfrom the wall.\\r\\n‘Ashes,’ he said. ‘Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It does \\r\\nnot exist. It never existed.’\\r\\n‘But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I re\\x02member it. You remember it.’\\r\\n‘I do not remember it,’ said O’Brien.\\r\\nWinston’s heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a \\r\\nfeeling of deadly helplessness. If he could have been certain \\r\\nthat O’Brien was lying, it would not have seemed to matter. \\r\\nBut it was perfectly possible that O’Brien had really forgot\\x02ten the photograph. And if so, then already he would have \\r\\nforgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the \\r\\nact of forgetting. How could one be sure that it was simple \\r\\ntrickery? Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 313\\r\\nreally happen: that was the thought that defeated him.\\r\\nO’Brien was looking down at him speculatively. More \\r\\nthan ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a \\r\\nwayward but promising child.\\r\\n‘There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of the \\r\\npast,’ he said. ‘Repeat it, if you please.’\\r\\n‘’Who controls the past controls the future: who controls \\r\\nthe present controls the past,‘‘ repeated Winston obedient\\x02ly.\\r\\n‘’Who controls the present controls the past,‘‘ said \\r\\nO’Brien, nodding his head with slow approval. ‘Is it your \\r\\nopinion, Winston, that the past has real existence?’\\r\\nAgain the feeling of helplessness descended upon Win\\x02ston. His eyes flitted towards the dial. He not only did not \\r\\nknow whether ‘yes’ or ‘no’ was the answer that would save \\r\\nhim from pain; he did not even know which answer he be\\x02lieved to be the true one.\\r\\nO’Brien smiled faintly. ‘You are no metaphysician, Win\\x02ston,’ he said. ‘Until this moment you had never considered \\r\\nwhat is meant by existence. I will put it more precisely. Does \\r\\nthe past exist concretely, in space? Is there somewhere or \\r\\nother a place, a world of solid objects, where the past is still \\r\\nhappening?’\\r\\n‘No.’\\r\\n‘Then where does the past exist, if at all?’\\r\\n‘In records. It is written down.’\\r\\n‘In records. And——?’\\r\\n‘In the mind. In human memories.’\\r\\n‘In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all \\n314 1984\\r\\nrecords, and we control all memories. Then we control the \\r\\npast, do we not?’\\r\\n‘But how can you stop people remembering things?’ cried \\r\\nWinston again momentarily forgetting the dial. ‘It is invol\\x02untary. It is outside oneself. How can you control memory? \\r\\nYou have not controlled mine!’\\r\\nO’Brien’s manner grew stern again. He laid his hand on \\r\\nthe dial.\\r\\n‘On the contrary,’ he said, ‘YOU have not controlled it. \\r\\nThat is what has brought you here. You are here because \\r\\nyou have failed in humility, in self-discipline. You would \\r\\nnot make the act of submission which is the price of san\\x02ity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only \\r\\nthe disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe \\r\\nthat reality is something objective, external, existing in its \\r\\nown right. You also believe that the nature of reality is self\\x02evident. When you delude yourself into thinking that you \\r\\nsee something, you assume that everyone else sees the same \\r\\nthing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not ex\\x02ternal. Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. \\r\\nNot in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and \\r\\nin any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, \\r\\nwhich is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds \\r\\nto be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except \\r\\nby looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact \\r\\nthat you have got to relearn, Winston. It needs an act of self\\x02destruction, an effort of the will. You must humble yourself \\r\\nbefore you can become sane.’\\r\\nHe paused for a few moments, as though to allow what \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 315\\r\\nhe had been saying to sink in.\\r\\n‘Do you remember,’ he went on, ‘writing in your dia\\x02ry, ‘Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make \\r\\nfour’?’\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said Winston.\\r\\nO’Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, \\r\\nwith the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended.\\r\\n‘How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?’\\r\\n‘Four.’\\r\\n‘And if the party says that it is not four but five—then \\r\\nhow many?’\\r\\n‘Four.’\\r\\nThe word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial \\r\\nhad shot up to fifty-five. The sweat had sprung out all over \\r\\nWinston’s body. The air tore into his lungs and issued again \\r\\nin deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he could \\r\\nnot stop. O’Brien watched him, the four fingers still ex\\x02tended. He drew back the lever. This time the pain was only \\r\\nslightly eased.\\r\\n‘How many fingers, Winston?’\\r\\n‘Four.’\\r\\nThe needle went up to sixty.\\r\\n‘How many fingers, Winston?’\\r\\n‘Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!’\\r\\nThe needle must have risen again, but he did not look at \\r\\nit. The heavy, stern face and the four fingers filled his vision. \\r\\nThe fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars, enormous, \\r\\nblurry, and seeming to vibrate, but unmistakably four.\\r\\n‘How many fingers, Winston?’\\n316 1984\\r\\n‘Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!’\\r\\n‘How many fingers, Winston?’\\r\\n‘Five! Five! Five!’\\r\\n‘No, Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still think \\r\\nthere are four. How many fingers, please?’\\r\\n‘Four! five! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop \\r\\nthe pain!’\\r\\nAbruptly he was sitting up with O’Brien’s arm round his \\r\\nshoulders. He had perhaps lost consciousness for a few sec\\x02onds. The bonds that had held his body down were loosened. \\r\\nHe felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably, his teeth \\r\\nwere chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. For \\r\\na moment he clung to O’Brien like a baby, curiously com\\x02forted by the heavy arm round his shoulders. He had the \\r\\nfeeling that O’Brien was his protector, that the pain was \\r\\nsomething that came from outside, from some other source, \\r\\nand that it was O’Brien who would save him from it.\\r\\n‘You are a slow learner, Winston,’ said O’Brien gently.\\r\\n‘How can I help it?’ he blubbered. ‘How can I help seeing \\r\\nwhat is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four.’\\r\\nSometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Some\\x02times they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. \\r\\nYou must try harder. It is not easy to become sane.’\\r\\nHe laid Winston down on the bed. The grip of his limbs \\r\\ntightened again, but the pain had ebbed away and the \\r\\ntrembling had stopped, leaving him merely weak and cold. \\r\\nO’Brien motioned with his head to the man in the white \\r\\ncoat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. \\r\\nThe man in the white coat bent down and looked closely \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 317\\r\\ninto Winston’s eyes, felt his pulse, laid an ear against his \\r\\nchest, tapped here and there, then he nodded to O’Brien.\\r\\n‘Again,’ said O’Brien.\\r\\nThe pain flowed into Winston’s body. The needle must be \\r\\nat seventy, seventy-five. He had shut his eyes this time. He \\r\\nknew that the fingers were still there, and still four. All that \\r\\nmattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm was \\r\\nover. He had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or \\r\\nnot. The pain lessened again. He opened his eyes. O’Brien \\r\\nhad drawn back the lever.\\r\\n‘How many fingers, Winston?’\\r\\n‘Four. I suppose there are four. I would see five if I could. \\r\\nI am trying to see five.’\\r\\n‘Which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or \\r\\nreally to see them?’\\r\\n‘Really to see them.’\\r\\n‘Again,’ said O’Brien.\\r\\nPerhaps the needle was eighty—ninety. Winston could \\r\\nnot intermittently remember why the pain was happening. \\r\\nBehind his screwed-up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to \\r\\nbe moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and out, disap\\x02pearing behind one another and reappearing again. He was \\r\\ntrying to count them, he could not remember why. He knew \\r\\nonly that it was impossible to count them, and that this was \\r\\nsomehow due to the mysterious identity between five and \\r\\nfour. The pain died down again. When he opened his eyes \\r\\nit was to find that he was still seeing the same thing. In\\x02numerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streaming \\r\\npast in either direction, crossing and recrossing. He shut \\n318 1984\\r\\nhis eyes again.\\r\\n‘How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?’\\r\\n‘I don’t know. I don’t know. You will kill me if you do that \\r\\nagain. Four, five, six—in all honesty I don’t know.’\\r\\n‘Better,’ said O’Brien.\\r\\nA needle slid into Winston’s arm. Almost in the same in\\x02stant a blissful, healing warmth spread all through his body. \\r\\nThe pain was already half-forgotten. He opened his eyes \\r\\nand looked up gratefully at O’Brien. At sight of the heavy, \\r\\nlined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart seemed to \\r\\nturn over. If he could have moved he would have stretched \\r\\nout a hand and laid it on O’Brien’s arm. He had never loved \\r\\nhim so deeply as at this moment, and not merely because \\r\\nhe had stopped the pain. The old feeling, that at bottom it \\r\\ndid not matter whether O’Brien was a friend or an enemy, \\r\\nhad come back. O’Brien was a person who could be talked \\r\\nto. Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be \\r\\nunderstood. O’Brien had tortured him to the edge of luna\\x02cy, and in a little while, it was certain, he would send him \\r\\nto his death. It made no difference. In some sense that went \\r\\ndeeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere or \\r\\nother, although the actual words might never be spoken, \\r\\nthere was a place where they could meet and talk. O’Brien \\r\\nwas looking down at him with an expression which suggest\\x02ed that the same thought might be in his own mind. When \\r\\nhe spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.\\r\\n‘Do you know where you are, Winston?’ he said.\\r\\n‘I don’t know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.’\\r\\n‘Do you know how long you have been here?’\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 319\\r\\n‘I don’t know. Days, weeks, months—I think it is \\r\\nmonths.’\\r\\n‘And why do you imagine that we bring people to this \\r\\nplace?’\\r\\n‘To make them confess.’\\r\\n‘No, that is not the reason. Try again.’\\r\\n‘To punish them.’\\r\\n‘No!’ exclaimed O’Brien. His voice had changed extraor\\x02dinarily, and his face had suddenly become both stern and \\r\\nanimated. ‘No! Not merely to extract your confession, not to \\r\\npunish you. Shall I tell you why we have brought you here? \\r\\nTo cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand, Win\\x02ston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves \\r\\nour hands uncured? We are not interested in those stupid \\r\\ncrimes that you have committed. The Party is not interested \\r\\nin the overt act: the thought is all we care about. We do not \\r\\nmerely destroy our enemies, we change them. Do you un\\x02derstand what I mean by that?’\\r\\nHe was bending over Winston. His face looked enormous \\r\\nbecause of its nearness, and hideously ugly because it was \\r\\nseen from below. Moreover it was filled with a sort of exal\\x02tation, a lunatic intensity. Again Winston’s heart shrank. If \\r\\nit had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the \\r\\nbed. He felt certain that O’Brien was about to twist the dial \\r\\nout of sheer wantonness. At this moment, however, O’Brien \\r\\nturned away. He took a pace or two up and down. Then he \\r\\ncontinued less vehemently:\\r\\n‘The first thing for you to understand is that in this place \\r\\nthere are no martyrdoms. You have read of the religious \\n320 1984\\r\\npersecutions of the past. In the Middle Ages there was the \\r\\nInquisitlon. It was a failure. It set out to eradicate heresy, and \\r\\nended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it burned at the \\r\\nstake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Because \\r\\nthe Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed \\r\\nthem while they were still unrepentant: in fact, it killed \\r\\nthem because they were unrepentant. Men were dying be\\x02cause they would not abandon their true beliefs. Naturally \\r\\nall the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to the \\r\\nInquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, \\r\\nthere were the totalitarians, as they were called. There were \\r\\nthe German Nazis and the Russian Communists. The Rus\\x02sians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the Inquisition \\r\\nhad done. And they imagined that they had learned from \\r\\nthe mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one \\r\\nmust not make martyrs. Before they exposed their victims \\r\\nto public trial, they deliberately set themselves to destroy \\r\\ntheir dignity. They wore them down by torture and solitude \\r\\nuntil they were despicable, cringing wretches, confessing \\r\\nwhatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves \\r\\nwith abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, \\r\\nwhimpering for mercy. And yet after only a few years the \\r\\nsame thing had happened over again. The dead men had \\r\\nbecome martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Once \\r\\nagain, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions \\r\\nthat they had made were obviously extorted and untrue. We \\r\\ndo not make mistakes of that kind. All the confessions that \\r\\nare uttered here are true. We make them true. And above \\r\\nall we do not allow the dead to rise up against us. You must \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 321\\r\\nstop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Winston. \\r\\nPosterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out \\r\\nfrom the stream of history. We shall turn you into gas and \\r\\npour you into the stratosphere. Nothing will remain of you, \\r\\nnot a name in a register, not a memory in a living brain. You \\r\\nwill be annihilated in the past as well as in the future. You \\r\\nwill never have existed.’\\r\\nThen why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a \\r\\nmomentary bitterness. O’Brien checked his step as though \\r\\nWinston had uttered the thought aloud. His large ugly face \\r\\ncame nearer, with the eyes a little narrowed.\\r\\n‘You are thinking,’ he said, ‘that since we intend to de\\x02stroy you utterly, so that nothing that you say or do can \\r\\nmake the smallest difference—in that case, why do we go to \\r\\nthe trouble of interrogating you first? That is what you were \\r\\nthinking, was it not?’\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said Winston.\\r\\nO’Brien smiled slightly. ‘You are a flaw in the pattern, \\r\\nWinston. You are a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not \\r\\ntell you just now that we are different from the persecutors \\r\\nof the past? We are not content with negative obedience, nor \\r\\neven with the most abject submission. When finally you \\r\\nsurrender to us, it must be of your own free will. We do not \\r\\ndestroy the heretic because he resists us: so long as he re\\x02sists us we never destroy him. We convert him, we capture \\r\\nhis inner mind, we reshape him. We burn all evil and all \\r\\nillusion out of him; we bring him over to our side, not in ap\\x02pearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one \\r\\nof ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that \\n322 1984\\r\\nan erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world, \\r\\nhowever secret and powerless it may be. Even in the instant \\r\\nof death we cannot permit any deviation. In the old days the \\r\\nheretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming his \\r\\nheresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges \\r\\ncould carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked \\r\\ndown the passage waiting for the bullet. But we make the \\r\\nbrain perfect before we blow it out. The command of the old \\r\\ndespotisms was ‘Thou shalt not”. The command of the total\\x02itarians was ‘Thou shalt”. Our command is ‘THOU ART”. \\r\\nNo one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against \\r\\nus. Everyone is washed clean. Even those three miserable \\r\\ntraitors in whose innocence you once believed—Jones, Aar\\x02onson, and Rutherford—in the end we broke them down. I \\r\\ntook part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradu\\x02ally worn down, whimpering, grovelling, weeping—and in \\r\\nthe end it was not with pain or fear, only with penitence. \\r\\nBy the time we had finished with them they were only the \\r\\nshells of men. There was nothing left in them except sor\\x02row for what they had done, and love of Big Brother. It was \\r\\ntouching to see how they loved him. They begged to be shot \\r\\nquickly, so that they could die while their minds were still \\r\\nclean.’\\r\\nHis voice had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation, the \\r\\nlunatic enthusiasm, was still in his face. He is not pretend\\x02ing, thought Winston, he is not a hypocrite, he believes \\r\\nevery word he says. What most oppressed him was the con\\x02sciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. He watched \\r\\nthe heavy yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 323\\r\\nof the range of his vision. O’Brien was a being in all ways \\r\\nlarger than himself. There was no idea that he had ever had, \\r\\nor could have, that O’Brien had not long ago known, ex\\x02amined, and rejected. His mind CONTAINED Winston’s \\r\\nmind. But in that case how could it be true that O’Brien was \\r\\nmad? It must be he, Winston, who was mad. O’Brien halted \\r\\nand looked down at him. His voice had grown stern again.\\r\\n‘Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, \\r\\nhowever completely you surrender to us. No one who has \\r\\nonce gone astray is ever spared. And even if we chose to let \\r\\nyou live out the natural term of your life, still you would \\r\\nnever escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever. \\r\\nUnderstand that in advance. We shall crush you down to \\r\\nthe point from which there is no coming back. Things will \\r\\nhappen to you from which you could not recover, if you \\r\\nlived a thousand years. Never again will you be capable of \\r\\nordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside \\r\\nyou. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, \\r\\nor joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or in\\x02tegrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and \\r\\nthen we shall fill you with ourselves.’\\r\\nHe paused and signed to the man in the white coat. \\r\\nWinston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being \\r\\npushed into place behind his head. O’Brien had sat down \\r\\nbeside the bed, so that his face was almost on a level with \\r\\nWinston’s.\\r\\n‘Three thousand,’ he said, speaking over Winston’s head \\r\\nto the man in the white coat.\\r\\nTwo soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped them-\\n324 1984\\r\\nselves against Winston’s temples. He quailed. There was \\r\\npain coming, a new kind of pain. O’Brien laid a hand reas\\x02suringly, almost kindly, on his.\\r\\n‘This time it will not hurt,’ he said. ‘Keep your eyes fixed \\r\\non mine.’\\r\\nAt this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what \\r\\nseemed like an explosion, though it was not certain whether \\r\\nthere was any noise. There was undoubtedly a blinding flash \\r\\nof light. Winston was not hurt, only prostrated. Although \\r\\nhe had already been lying on his back when the thing hap\\x02pened, he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked \\r\\ninto that position. A terrific painless blow had flattened him \\r\\nout. Also something had happened inside his head. As his \\r\\neyes regained their focus he remembered who he was, and \\r\\nwhere he was, and recognized the face that was gazing into \\r\\nhis own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch \\r\\nof emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his \\r\\nbrain.\\r\\n‘It will not last,’ said O’Brien. ‘Look me in the eyes. What \\r\\ncountry is Oceania at war with?’\\r\\nWinston thought. He knew what was meant by Oceania \\r\\nand that he himself was a citizen of Oceania. He also re\\x02membered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who was at war with \\r\\nwhom he did not know. In fact he had not been aware that \\r\\nthere was any war.\\r\\n‘I don’t remember.’\\r\\n‘Oceania is at war with Eastasia. Do you remember that \\r\\nnow?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 325\\r\\n‘Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Since the \\r\\nbeginning of your life, since the beginning of the Party, \\r\\nsince the beginning of history, the war has continued with\\x02out a break, always the same war. Do you remember that?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘Eleven years ago you created a legend about three men \\r\\nwho had been condemned to death for treachery. You pre\\x02tended that you had seen a piece of paper which proved \\r\\nthem innocent. No such piece of paper ever existed. You in\\x02vented it, and later you grew to believe in it. You remember \\r\\nnow the very moment at which you first invented it. Do you \\r\\nremember that?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘Just now I held up the fingers of my hand to you. You saw \\r\\nfive fingers. Do you remember that?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\nO’Brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with the \\r\\nthumb concealed.\\r\\n‘There are five fingers there. Do you see five fingers?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\nAnd he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before the \\r\\nscenery of his mind changed. He saw five fingers, and there \\r\\nwas no deformity. Then everything was normal again, and \\r\\nthe old fear, the hatred, and the bewilderment came crowd\\x02ing back again. But there had been a moment—he did not \\r\\nknow how long, thirty seconds, perhaps—of luminous cer\\x02tainty, when each new suggestion of O’Brien’s had filled up \\r\\na patch of emptiness and become absolute truth, and when \\r\\ntwo and two could have been three as easily as five, if that \\n326 1984\\r\\nwere what was needed. It had faded but before O’Brien had \\r\\ndropped his hand; but though he could not recapture it, he \\r\\ncould remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience at \\r\\nsome period of one’s life when one was in effect a different \\r\\nperson.\\r\\n‘You see now,’ said O’Brien, ‘that it is at any rate possi\\x02ble.’\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said Winston.\\r\\nO’Brien stood up with a satisfied air. Over to his left \\r\\nWinston saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule \\r\\nand draw back the plunger of a syringe. O’Brien turned to \\r\\nWinston with a smile. In almost the old manner he resettled \\r\\nhis spectacles on his nose.\\r\\n‘Do you remember writing in your diary,’ he said, ‘that \\r\\nit did not matter whether I was a friend or an enemy, since \\r\\nI was at least a person who understood you and could be \\r\\ntalked to? You were right. I enjoy talking to you. Your mind \\r\\nappeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you \\r\\nhappen to be insane. Before we bring the session to an end \\r\\nyou can ask me a few questions, if you choose.’\\r\\n‘Any question I like?’\\r\\n‘Anything.’ He saw that Winston’s eyes were upon the \\r\\ndial. ‘It is switched off. What is your first question?’\\r\\n‘What have you done with Julia?’ said Winston.\\r\\nO’Brien smiled again. ‘She betrayed you, Winston. Im\\x02mediately—unreservedly. I have seldom seen anyone come \\r\\nover to us so promptly. You would hardly recognize her if \\r\\nyou saw her. All her rebelliousness, her deceit, her folly, her \\r\\ndirty-mindedness—everything has been burned out of her. \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 327\\r\\nIt was a perfect conversion, a textbook case.’\\r\\n‘You tortured her?’\\r\\nO’Brien left this unanswered. ‘Next question,’ he said.\\r\\n‘Does Big Brother exist?’\\r\\n‘Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is the \\r\\nembodiment of the Party.’\\r\\n‘Does he exist in the same way as I exist?’\\r\\n‘You do not exist,’ said O’Brien.\\r\\nOnce again the sense of helplessness assailed him. He \\r\\nknew, or he could imagine, the arguments which proved \\r\\nhis own nonexistence; but they were nonsense, they were \\r\\nonly a play on words. Did not the statement, ‘You do not ex\\x02ist’, contain a logical absurdity? But what use was it to say \\r\\nso? His mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable, \\r\\nmad arguments with which O’Brien would demolish him.\\r\\n‘I think I exist,’ he said wearily. ‘I am conscious of my \\r\\nown identity. I was born and I shall die. I have arms and \\r\\nlegs. I occupy a particular point in space. No other solid \\r\\nobject can occupy the same point simultaneously. In that \\r\\nsense, does Big Brother exist?’\\r\\n‘It is of no importance. He exists.’\\r\\n‘Will Big Brother ever die?’\\r\\n‘Of course not. How could he die? Next question.’\\r\\n‘Does the Brotherhood exist?’\\r\\n‘That, Winston, you will never know. If we choose to set \\r\\nyou free when we have finished with you, and if you live to \\r\\nbe ninety years old, still you will never learn whether the \\r\\nanswer to that question is Yes or No. As long as you live it \\r\\nwill be an unsolved riddle in your mind.’\\n328 1984\\r\\nWinston lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster. \\r\\nHe still had not asked the question that had come into his \\r\\nmind the first. He had got to ask it, and yet it was as though \\r\\nhis tongue would not utter it. There was a trace of amuse\\x02ment in O’Brien’s face. Even his spectacles seemed to wear \\r\\nan ironical gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly, \\r\\nhe knows what I am going to ask! At the thought the words \\r\\nburst out of him:\\r\\n‘What is in Room 101?’\\r\\nThe expression on O’Brien’s face did not change. He an\\x02swered drily:\\r\\n‘You know what is in Room 101, Winston. Everyone \\r\\nknows what is in Room 101.’\\r\\nHe raised a finger to the man in the white coat. Evidently \\r\\nthe session was at an end. A needle jerked into Winston’s \\r\\narm. He sank almost instantly into deep sleep.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 329\\r\\nChapter 3\\r\\n‘\\r\\nThere are three stages in your reintegration,’ said O’Brien. \\r\\n‘There is learning, there is understanding, and there is ac\\x02ceptance. It is time for you to enter upon the second stage.’\\r\\nAs always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late \\r\\nhis bonds were looser. They still held him to the bed, but \\r\\nhe could move his knees a little and could turn his head \\r\\nfrom side to side and raise his arms from the elbow. The \\r\\ndial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He could evade its \\r\\npangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when he \\r\\nshowed stupidity that O’Brien pulled the lever. Sometimes \\r\\nthey got through a whole session without use of the dial. \\r\\nHe could not remember how many sessions there had been. \\r\\nThe whole process seemed to stretch out over a long, indefi\\x02nite time—weeks, possibly—and the intervals between the \\r\\nsessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes only \\r\\nan hour or two.\\r\\n‘As you lie there,’ said O’Brien, ‘you have often won\\x02dered—you have even asked me—why the Ministry of Love \\r\\nshould expend so much time and trouble on you. And when \\r\\nyou were free you were puzzled by what was essentially the \\r\\nsame question. You could grasp the mechanics of the So\\x02ciety you lived in, but not its underlying motives. Do you \\r\\nremember writing in your diary, ‘I understand HOW: I do \\r\\nnot understand WHY’? It was when you thought about \\n330 1984\\r\\n‘why’ that you doubted your own sanity. You have read THE \\r\\nBOOK, Goldstein’s book, or parts of it, at least. Did it tell \\r\\nyou anything that you did not know already?’\\r\\n‘You have read it?’ said Winston.\\r\\n‘I wrote it. That is to say, I collaborated in writing it. No \\r\\nbook is produced individually, as you know.’\\r\\n‘Is it true, what it says?’\\r\\n‘As description, yes. The programme it sets forth is non\\x02sense. The secret accumulation of knowledge—a gradual \\r\\nspread of enlightenment—ultimately a proletarian rebel\\x02lion—the overthrow of the Party. You foresaw yourself that \\r\\nthat was what it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletar\\x02ians will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. \\r\\nThey cannot. I do not have to tell you the reason: you know \\r\\nit already. If you have ever cherished any dreams of violent \\r\\ninsurrection, you must abandon them. There is no way in \\r\\nwhich the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is \\r\\nfor ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.’\\r\\nHe came closer to the bed. ‘For ever!’ he repeated. ‘And \\r\\nnow let us get back to the question of ‘how’ and ‘why”. You \\r\\nunderstand well enough HOW the Party maintains itself \\r\\nin power. Now tell me WHY we cling to power. What is \\r\\nour motive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak,’ he \\r\\nadded as Winston remained silent.\\r\\nNevertheless Winston did not speak for another mo\\x02ment or two. A feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him. \\r\\nThe faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back into \\r\\nO’Brien’s face. He knew in advance what O’Brien would say. \\r\\nThat the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 331\\r\\nfor the good of the majority. That it sought power because \\r\\nmen in the mass were frail, cowardly creatures who could \\r\\nnot endure liberty or face the truth, and must be ruled over \\r\\nand systematically deceived by others who were stronger \\r\\nthan themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between \\r\\nfreedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of man\\x02kind, happiness was better. That the party was the eternal \\r\\nguardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing evil that good \\r\\nmight come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of oth\\x02ers. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing \\r\\nwas that when O’Brien said this he would believe it. You \\r\\ncould see it in his face. O’Brien knew everything. A thou\\x02sand times better than Winston he knew what the world \\r\\nwas really like, in what degradation the mass of human be\\x02ings lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept \\r\\nthem there. He had understood it all, weighed it all, and it \\r\\nmade no difference: all was justified by the ultimate purpose. \\r\\nWhat can you do, thought Winston, against the lunatic who \\r\\nis more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments \\r\\na fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?\\r\\n‘You are ruling over us for our own good,’ he said feebly. \\r\\n‘You believe that human beings are not fit to govern them\\x02selves, and therefore——’\\r\\nHe started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shot \\r\\nthrough his body. O’Brien had pushed the lever of the dial \\r\\nup to thirty-five.\\r\\n‘That was stupid, Winston, stupid!’ he said. ‘You should \\r\\nknow better than to say a thing like that.’\\r\\nHe pulled the lever back and continued:\\n332 1984\\r\\n‘Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. \\r\\nThe Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not \\r\\ninterested in the good of others; we are interested solely \\r\\nin power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: \\r\\nonly power, pure power. What pure power means you will \\r\\nunderstand presently. We are different from all the oligar\\x02chies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All \\r\\nthe others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cow\\x02ards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian \\r\\nCommunists came very close to us in their methods, but \\r\\nthey never had the courage to recognize their own motives. \\r\\nThey pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had \\r\\nseized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that \\r\\njust round the corner there lay a paradise where human be\\x02ings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know \\r\\nthat no one ever seizes power with the intention of relin\\x02quishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not \\r\\nestablish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; \\r\\none makes the revolution in order to establish the dictator\\x02ship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of \\r\\ntorture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you \\r\\nbegin to understand me?’\\r\\nWinston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the \\r\\ntiredness of O’Brien’s face. It was strong and fleshy and bru\\x02tal, it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion \\r\\nbefore which he felt himself helpless; but it was tired. There \\r\\nwere pouches under the eyes, the skin sagged from the \\r\\ncheekbones. O’Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing \\r\\nthe worn face nearer.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 333\\r\\n‘You are thinking,’ he said, ‘that my face is old and tired. \\r\\nYou are thinking that I talk of power, and yet I am not even \\r\\nable to prevent the decay of my own body. Can you not un\\x02derstand, Winston, that the individual is only a cell? The \\r\\nweariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism. Do you \\r\\ndie when you cut your fingernails?’\\r\\nHe turned away from the bed and began strolling up and \\r\\ndown again, one hand in his pocket.\\r\\n‘We are the priests of power,’ he said. ‘God is power. But \\r\\nat present power is only a word so far as you are concerned. \\r\\nIt is time for you to gather some idea of what power means. \\r\\nThe first thing you must realize is that power is collective. \\r\\nThe individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an \\r\\nindividual. You know the Party slogan: ‘Freedom is Slavery”. \\r\\nHas it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery is \\r\\nfreedom. Alone—free—the human being is always defeated. \\r\\nIt must be so, because every human being is doomed to die, \\r\\nwhich is the greatest of all failures. But if he can make com\\x02plete, utter submission, if he can escape from his identity, \\r\\nif he can merge himself in the Party so that he IS the Party, \\r\\nthen he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for \\r\\nyou to realize is that power is power over human beings. \\r\\nOver the body—but, above all, over the mind. Power over \\r\\nmatter—external reality, as you would call it—is not impor\\x02tant. Already our control over matter is absolute.’\\r\\nFor a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a vio\\x02lent effort to raise himself into a sitting position, and merely \\r\\nsucceeded in wrenching his body painfully.\\r\\n‘But how can you control matter?’ he burst out. ‘You don’t \\n334 1984\\r\\neven control the climate or the law of gravity. And there are \\r\\ndisease, pain, death——’\\r\\nO’Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. ‘We \\r\\ncontrol matter because we control the mind. Reality is in\\x02side the skull. You will learn by degrees, Winston. There is \\r\\nnothing that we could not do. Invisibility, levitation—any\\x02thing. I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish \\r\\nto. I do not wish to, because the Party does not wish it. You \\r\\nmust get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the \\r\\nlaws of Nature. We make the laws of Nature.’\\r\\n‘But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. \\r\\nWhat about Eurasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered \\r\\nthem yet.’\\r\\n‘Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. \\r\\nAnd if we did not, what difference would it make? We can \\r\\nshut them out of existence. Oceania is the world.’\\r\\n‘But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is \\r\\ntiny—helpless! How long has he been in existence? For mil\\x02lions of years the earth was uninhabited.’\\r\\n‘Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How \\r\\ncould it be older? Nothing exists except through human \\r\\nconsciousness.’\\r\\n‘But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals—\\r\\nmammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which \\r\\nlived here long before man was ever heard of.’\\r\\n‘Have you ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not. \\r\\nNineteenth-century biologists invented them. Before man \\r\\nthere was nothing. After man, if he could come to an end, \\r\\nthere would be nothing. Outside man there is nothing.’\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 335\\r\\n‘But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars! \\r\\nSome of them are a million light-years away. They are out of \\r\\nour reach for ever.’\\r\\n‘What are the stars?’ said O’Brien indifferently. ‘They are \\r\\nbits of fire a few kilometres away. We could reach them if we \\r\\nwanted to. Or we could blot them out. The earth is the cen\\x02tre of the universe. The sun and the stars go round it.’\\r\\nWinston made another convulsive movement. This time \\r\\nhe did not say anything. O’Brien continued as though an\\x02swering a spoken objection:\\r\\n‘For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When \\r\\nwe navigate the ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we of\\x02ten find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round \\r\\nthe sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of ki\\x02lometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is beyond \\r\\nus to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be \\r\\nnear or distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose \\r\\nour mathematicians are unequal to that? Have you forgot\\x02ten doublethink?’\\r\\nWinston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, \\r\\nthe swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he \\r\\nknew, he KNEW, that he was in the right. The belief that \\r\\nnothing exists outside your own mind—surely there must \\r\\nbe some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it not \\r\\nbeen exposed long ago as a fallacy? There was even a name \\r\\nfor it, which he had forgotten. A faint smile twitched the \\r\\ncorners of O’Brien’s mouth as he looked down at him.\\r\\n‘I told you, Winston,’ he said, ‘that metaphysics is not \\r\\nyour strong point. The word you are trying to think of is \\n336 1984\\r\\nsolipsism. But you are mistaken. This is not solipsism. Col\\x02lective solipsism, if you like. But that is a different thing: in \\r\\nfact, the opposite thing. All this is a digression,’ he added \\r\\nin a different tone. ‘The real power, the power we have to \\r\\nfight for night and day, is not power over things, but over \\r\\nmen.’ He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air \\r\\nof a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil: ‘How does \\r\\none man assert his power over another, Winston?’\\r\\nWinston thought. ‘By making him suffer,’ he said.\\r\\n‘Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. \\r\\nUnless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obey\\x02ing your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain \\r\\nand humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces \\r\\nand putting them together again in new shapes of your own \\r\\nchoosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we \\r\\nare creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonis\\x02tic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear \\r\\nand treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being \\r\\ntrampled upon, a world which will grow not less but MORE \\r\\nmerciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be \\r\\nprogress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed \\r\\nthat they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded \\r\\nupon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions ex\\x02cept fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything \\r\\nelse we shall destroy—everything. Already we are break\\x02ing down the habits of thought which have survived from \\r\\nbefore the Revolution. We have cut the links between child \\r\\nand parent, and between man and man, and between man \\r\\nand woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 337\\r\\nany longer. But in the future there will be no wives and \\r\\nno friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at \\r\\nbirth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be \\r\\neradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the \\r\\nrenewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our \\r\\nneurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loy\\x02alty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, \\r\\nexcept the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, ex\\x02cept the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will \\r\\nbe no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipo\\x02tent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no \\r\\ndistinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no \\r\\ncuriosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing \\r\\npleasures will be destroyed. But always—do not forget this, \\r\\nWinston—always there will be the intoxication of power, \\r\\nconstantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Al\\x02ways, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, \\r\\nthe sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If \\r\\nyou want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping \\r\\non a human face—for ever.’\\r\\nHe paused as though he expected Winston to speak. \\r\\nWinston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed \\r\\nagain. He could not say anything. His heart seemed to be \\r\\nfrozen. O’Brien went on:\\r\\n‘And remember that it is for ever. The face will always \\r\\nbe there to be stamped upon. The heretic, the enemy of so\\x02ciety, will always be there, so that he can be defeated and \\r\\nhumiliated over again. Everything that you have undergone \\r\\nsince you have been in our hands—all that will continue, \\n338 1984\\r\\nand worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tor\\x02tures, the executions, the disappearances will never cease. \\r\\nIt will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph. \\r\\nThe more the Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant: \\r\\nthe weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism. Gold\\x02stein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day, at every \\r\\nmoment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat \\r\\nupon and yet they will always survive. This drama that I \\r\\nhave played out with you during seven years will be played \\r\\nout over and over again generation after generation, always \\r\\nin subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here at our \\r\\nmercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible—and \\r\\nin the end utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to \\r\\nour feet of his own accord. That is the world that we are pre\\x02paring, Winston. A world of victory after victory, triumph \\r\\nafter triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing, \\r\\npressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning, I can \\r\\nsee, to realize what that world will be like. But in the end \\r\\nyou will do more than understand it. You will accept it, wel\\x02come it, become part of it.’\\r\\nWinston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak. \\r\\n‘You can’t!’ he said weakly.\\r\\n‘What do you mean by that remark, Winston?’\\r\\n‘You could not create such a world as you have just de\\x02scribed. It is a dream. It is impossible.’\\r\\n‘Why?’\\r\\n‘It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred \\r\\nand cruelty. It would never endure.’\\r\\n‘Why not?’\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 339\\r\\n‘It would have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would \\r\\ncommit suicide.’\\r\\n‘Nonsense. You are under the impression that hatred is \\r\\nmore exhausting than love. Why should it be? And if it were, \\r\\nwhat difference would that make? Suppose that we choose \\r\\nto wear ourselves out faster. Suppose that we quicken the \\r\\ntempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. Still what \\r\\ndifference would it make? Can you not understand that the \\r\\ndeath of the individual is not death? The party is immor\\x02tal.’\\r\\nAs usual, the voice had battered Winston into helpless\\x02ness. Moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in his \\r\\ndisagreement O’Brien would twist the dial again. And yet \\r\\nhe could not keep silent. Feebly, without arguments, with \\r\\nnothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of \\r\\nwhat O’Brien had said, he returned to the attack.\\r\\n‘I don’t know—I don’t care. Somehow you will fail. Some\\x02thing will defeat you. Life will defeat you.’\\r\\n‘We control life, Winston, at all its levels. You are imag\\x02ining that there is something called human nature which \\r\\nwill be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But \\r\\nwe create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable. Or \\r\\nperhaps you have returned to your old idea that the prole\\x02tarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us. Put it out \\r\\nof your mind. They are helpless, like the animals. Humanity \\r\\nis the Party. The others are outside—irrelevant.’\\r\\n‘I don’t care. In the end they will beat you. Sooner or later \\r\\nthey will see you for what you are, and then they will tear \\r\\nyou to pieces.’\\n340 1984\\r\\n‘Do you see any evidence that that is happening? Or any \\r\\nreason why it should?’\\r\\n‘No. I believe it. I KNOW that you will fail. There is \\r\\nsomething in the universe—I don’t know, some spirit, some \\r\\nprinciple—that you will never overcome.’\\r\\n‘Do you believe in God, Winston?’\\r\\n‘No.’\\r\\n‘Then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?’\\r\\n‘I don’t know. The spirit of Man.’\\r\\n‘And do you consider yourself a man?’\\r\\n‘Yes.’\\r\\n‘If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Your \\r\\nkind is extinct; we are the inheritors. Do you understand \\r\\nthat you are ALONE? You are outside history, you are non\\x02existent.’ His manner changed and he said more harshly: \\r\\n‘And you consider yourself morally superior to us, with our \\r\\nlies and our cruelty?’\\r\\n‘Yes, I consider myself superior.’\\r\\nO’Brien did not speak. Two other voices were speaking. \\r\\nAfter a moment Winston recognized one of them as his \\r\\nown. It was a sound-track of the conversation he had had \\r\\nwith O’Brien, on the night when he had enrolled himself in \\r\\nthe Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal, \\r\\nto forge, to murder, to encourage drug-taking and prosti\\x02tution, to disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol \\r\\nin a child’s face. O’Brien made a small impatient gesture, \\r\\nas though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth \\r\\nmaking. Then he turned a switch and the voices stopped.\\r\\n‘Get up from that bed,’ he said.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 341\\r\\nThe bonds had loosened themselves. Winston lowered \\r\\nhimself to the floor and stood up unsteadily.\\r\\n‘You are the last man,’ said O’Brien. ‘You are the guard\\x02ian of the human spirit. You shall see yourself as you are. \\r\\nTake off your clothes.’\\r\\nWinston undid the bit of string that held his overalls to\\x02gether. The zip fastener had long since been wrenched out of \\r\\nthem. He could not remember whether at any time since his \\r\\narrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time. Beneath \\r\\nthe overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags, \\r\\njust recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As he \\r\\nslid them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided \\r\\nmirror at the far end of the room. He approached it, then \\r\\nstopped short. An involuntary cry had broken out of him.\\r\\n‘Go on,’ said O’Brien. ‘Stand between the wings of the \\r\\nmirror. You shall see the side view as well.’\\r\\nHe had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, \\r\\ngrey-coloured, skeleton-like thing was coming towards \\r\\nhim. Its actual appearance was frightening, and not merely \\r\\nthe fact that he knew it to be himself. He moved closer to \\r\\nthe glass. The creature’s face seemed to be protruded, be\\x02cause of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird’s face with a \\r\\nnobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked \\r\\nnose, and battered-looking cheekbones above which his \\r\\neyes were fierce and watchful. The cheeks were seamed, the \\r\\nmouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was his own face, \\r\\nbut it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had \\r\\nchanged inside. The emotions it registered would be differ\\x02ent from the ones he felt. He had gone partially bald. For the \\n342 1984\\r\\nfirst moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well, \\r\\nbut it was only the scalp that was grey. Except for his hands \\r\\nand a circle of his face, his body was grey all over with an\\x02cient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt there \\r\\nwere the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the vari\\x02cose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling \\r\\noff it. But the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of \\r\\nhis body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a \\r\\nskeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker \\r\\nthan the thighs. He saw now what O’Brien had meant about \\r\\nseeing the side view. The curvature of the spine was aston\\x02ishing. The thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to \\r\\nmake a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck seemed to be \\r\\nbending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess he \\r\\nwould have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suf\\x02fering from some malignant disease.\\r\\n‘You have thought sometimes,’ said O’Brien, ‘that my \\r\\nface—the face of a member of the Inner Party—looks old \\r\\nand worn. What do you think of your own face?’\\r\\nHe seized Winston’s shoulder and spun him round so \\r\\nthat he was facing him.\\r\\n‘Look at the condition you are in!’ he said. ‘Look at this \\r\\nfilthy grime all over your body. Look at the dirt between \\r\\nyour toes. Look at that disgusting running sore on your leg. \\r\\nDo you know that you stink like a goat? Probably you have \\r\\nceased to notice it. Look at your emaciation. Do you see? I \\r\\ncan make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep. \\r\\nI could snap your neck like a carrot. Do you know that you \\r\\nhave lost twenty-five kilograms since you have been in our \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 343\\r\\nhands? Even your hair is coming out in handfuls. Look!’ He \\r\\nplucked at Winston’s head and brought away a tuft of hair. \\r\\n‘Open your mouth. Nine, ten, eleven teeth left. How many \\r\\nhad you when you came to us? And the few you have left are \\r\\ndropping out of your head. Look here!’\\r\\nHe seized one of Winston’s remaining front teeth be\\x02tween his powerful thumb and forefinger. A twinge of pain \\r\\nshot through Winston’s jaw. O’Brien had wrenched the \\r\\nloose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across the cell.\\r\\n‘You are rotting away,’ he said; ‘you are falling to pieces. \\r\\nWhat are you? A bag of filth. Now turn around and look \\r\\ninto that mirror again. Do you see that thing facing you? \\r\\nThat is the last man. If you are human, that is humanity. \\r\\nNow put your clothes on again.’\\r\\nWinston began to dress himself with slow stiff move\\x02ments. Until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and \\r\\nweak he was. Only one thought stirred in his mind: that he \\r\\nmust have been in this place longer than he had imagined. \\r\\nThen suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself \\r\\na feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him. Before \\r\\nhe knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a small \\r\\nstool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears. He was \\r\\naware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of bones in \\r\\nfilthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: \\r\\nbut he could not stop himself. O’Brien laid a hand on his \\r\\nshoulder, almost kindly.\\r\\n‘It will not last for ever,’ he said. ‘You can escape from it \\r\\nwhenever you choose. Everything depends on yourself.’\\r\\n‘You did it!’ sobbed Winston. ‘You reduced me to this \\n344 1984\\r\\nstate.’\\r\\n‘No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what you \\r\\naccepted when you set yourself up against the Party. It was \\r\\nall contained in that first act. Nothing has happened that \\r\\nyou did not foresee.’\\r\\nHe paused, and then went on:\\r\\n‘We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. \\r\\nYou have seen what your body is like. Your mind is in the \\r\\nsame state. I do not think there can be much pride left in \\r\\nyou. You have been kicked and flogged and insulted, you \\r\\nhave screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in \\r\\nyour own blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy, \\r\\nyou have betrayed everybody and everything. Can you think \\r\\nof a single degradation that has not happened to you?’\\r\\nWinston had stopped weeping, though the tears were \\r\\nstill oozing out of his eyes. He looked up at O’Brien.\\r\\n‘I have not betrayed Julia,’ he said.\\r\\nO’Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. ‘No,’ he said; \\r\\n‘no; that is perfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia.’\\r\\nThe peculiar reverence for O’Brien, which nothing \\r\\nseemed able to destroy, flooded Winston’s heart again. How \\r\\nintelligent, he thought, how intelligent! Never did O’Brien \\r\\nfail to understand what was said to him. Anyone else on \\r\\nearth would have answered promptly that he HAD be\\x02trayed Julia. For what was there that they had not screwed \\r\\nout of him under the torture? He had told them everything \\r\\nhe knew about her, her habits, her character, her past life; \\r\\nhe had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that \\r\\nhad happened at their meetings, all that he had said to her \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 345\\r\\nand she to him, their black-market meals, their adulteries, \\r\\ntheir vague plottings against the Party—everything. And \\r\\nyet, in the sense in which he intended the word, he had not \\r\\nbetrayed her. He had not stopped loving her; his feelings to\\x02wards her had remained the same. O’Brien had seen what \\r\\nhe meant without the need for explanation.\\r\\n‘Tell me,’ he said, ‘how soon will they shoot me?’\\r\\n‘It might be a long time,’ said O’Brien. ‘You are a difficult \\r\\ncase. But don’t give up hope. Everyone is cured sooner or \\r\\nlater. In the end we shall shoot you.’\\n346 1984\\r\\nChapter 4\\r\\nHe was much better. He was growing fatter and stronger \\r\\nevery day, if it was proper to speak of days.\\r\\nThe white light and the humming sound were the same \\r\\nas ever, but the cell was a little more comfortable than the \\r\\nothers he had been in. There was a pillow and a mattress on \\r\\nthe plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They had given him a \\r\\nbath, and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequent\\x02ly in a tin basin. They even gave him warm water to wash \\r\\nwith. They had given him new underclothes and a clean suit \\r\\nof overalls. They had dressed his varicose ulcer with sooth\\x02ing ointment. They had pulled out the remnants of his teeth \\r\\nand given him a new set of dentures.\\r\\nWeeks or months must have passed. It would have been \\r\\npossible now to keep count of the passage of time, if he had \\r\\nfelt any interest in doing so, since he was being fed at what \\r\\nappeared to be regular intervals. He was getting, he judged, \\r\\nthree meals in the twenty-four hours; sometimes he won\\x02dered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day. \\r\\nThe food was surprisingly good, with meat at every third \\r\\nmeal. Once there was even a packet of cigarettes. He had \\r\\nno matches, but the never-speaking guard who brought his \\r\\nfood would give him a light. The first time he tried to smoke \\r\\nit made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the packet out \\r\\nfor a long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 347\\r\\nThey had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil \\r\\ntied to the corner. At first he made no use of it. Even when \\r\\nhe was awake he was completely torpid. Often he would lie \\r\\nfrom one meal to the next almost without stirring, some\\x02times asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries in which \\r\\nit was too much trouble to open his eyes. He had long grown \\r\\nused to sleeping with a strong light on his face. It seemed \\r\\nto make no difference, except that one’s dreams were more \\r\\ncoherent. He dreamed a great deal all through this time, \\r\\nand they were always happy dreams. He was in the Golden \\r\\nCountry, or he was sitting among enormous glorious, sunlit \\r\\nruins, with his mother, with Julia, with O’Brien—not do\\x02ing anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful \\r\\nthings. Such thoughts as he had when he was awake were \\r\\nmostly about his dreams. He seemed to have lost the power \\r\\nof intellectual effort, now that the stimulus of pain had been \\r\\nremoved. He was not bored, he had no desire for conversa\\x02tion or distraction. Merely to be alone, not to be beaten or \\r\\nquestioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, \\r\\nwas completely satisfying.\\r\\nBy degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still \\r\\nfelt no impulse to get off the bed. All he cared for was to lie \\r\\nquiet and feel the strength gathering in his body. He would \\r\\nfinger himself here and there, trying to make sure that it \\r\\nwas not an illusion that his muscles were growing round\\x02er and his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond a \\r\\ndoubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now defi\\x02nitely thicker than his knees. After that, reluctantly at first, \\r\\nhe began exercising himself regularly. In a little while he \\n348 1984\\r\\ncould walk three kilometres, measured by pacing the cell, \\r\\nand his bowed shoulders were growing straighter. He at\\x02tempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and \\r\\nhumiliated to find what things he could not do. He could \\r\\nnot move out of a walk, he could not hold his stool out at \\r\\narm’s length, he could not stand on one leg without falling \\r\\nover. He squatted down on his heels, and found that with \\r\\nagonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself \\r\\nto a standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried to \\r\\nlift his weight by his hands. It was hopeless, he could not \\r\\nraise himself a centimetre. But after a few more days—a few \\r\\nmore mealtimes—even that feat was accomplished. A time \\r\\ncame when he could do it six times running. He began to \\r\\ngrow actually proud of his body, and to cherish an inter\\x02mittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal. \\r\\nOnly when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did \\r\\nhe remember the seamed, ruined face that had looked back \\r\\nat him out of the mirror.\\r\\nHis mind grew more active. He sat down on the plank \\r\\nbed, his back against the wall and the slate on his knees, \\r\\nand set to work deliberately at the task of re-educating him\\x02self.\\r\\nHe had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as he saw \\r\\nnow, he had been ready to capitulate long before he had \\r\\ntaken the decision. From the moment when he was inside \\r\\nthe Ministry of Love—and yes, even during those minutes \\r\\nwhen he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice \\r\\nfrom the telescreen told them what to do—he had grasped \\r\\nthe frivolity, the shallowness of his attempt to set himself \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 349\\r\\nup against the power of the Party. He knew now that for \\r\\nseven years the Thought Police had watched him like a bee\\x02tle under a magnifying glass. There was no physical act, no \\r\\nword spoken aloud, that they had not noticed, no train of \\r\\nthought that they had not been able to infer. Even the speck \\r\\nof whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had careful\\x02ly replaced. They had played sound-tracks to him, shown \\r\\nhim photographs. Some of them were photographs of Julia \\r\\nand himself. Yes, even... He could not fight against the Party \\r\\nany longer. Besides, the Party was in the right. It must be \\r\\nso; how could the immortal, collective brain be mistaken? \\r\\nBy what external standard could you check its judgements? \\r\\nSanity was statistical. It was merely a question of learning \\r\\nto think as they thought. Only——!\\r\\nThe pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers. He be\\x02gan to write down the thoughts that came into his head. He \\r\\nwrote first in large clumsy capitals:\\r\\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY\\r\\nThen almost without a pause he wrote beneath it:\\r\\nTWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE\\r\\nBut then there came a sort of check. His mind, as though \\r\\nshying away from something, seemed unable to concen\\x02trate. He knew that he knew what came next, but for the \\r\\nmoment he could not recall it. When he did recall it, it was \\r\\nonly by consciously reasoning out what it must be: it did not \\n350 1984\\r\\ncome of its own accord. He wrote:\\r\\nGOD IS POWER \\r\\nHe accepted everything. The past was alterable. The past \\r\\nnever had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. \\r\\nOceania had always been at war with Eastasia. Jones, Aar\\x02onson, and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes they were \\r\\ncharged with. He had never seen the photograph that dis\\x02proved their guilt. It had never existed, he had invented it. \\r\\nHe remembered remembering contrary things, but those \\r\\nwere false memories, products of self-deception. How easy it \\r\\nall was! Only surrender, and everything else followed. It was \\r\\nlike swimming against a current that swept you backwards \\r\\nhowever hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to \\r\\nturn round and go with the current instead of opposing it. \\r\\nNothing had changed except your own attitude: the predes\\x02tined thing happened in any case. He hardly knew why he \\r\\nhad ever rebelled. Everything was easy, except——!\\r\\nAnything could be true. The so-called laws of Na\\x02ture were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense. ‘If I \\r\\nwished,’ O’Brien had said, ‘I could float off this floor like \\r\\na soap bubble.’ Winston worked it out. ‘If he THINKS he \\r\\nfloats off the floor, and if I simultaneously THINK I see \\r\\nhim do it, then the thing happens.’ Suddenly, like a lump \\r\\nof submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water, the \\r\\nthought burst into his mind: ‘It doesn’t really happen. We \\r\\nimagine it. It is hallucination.’ He pushed the thought un\\x02der instantly. The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 351\\r\\nsomewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a ‘real’ world \\r\\nwhere ‘real’ things happened. But how could there be such a \\r\\nworld? What knowledge have we of anything, save through \\r\\nour own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever \\r\\nhappens in all minds, truly happens.\\r\\nHe had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and he \\r\\nwas in no danger of succumbing to it. He realized, never\\x02theless, that it ought never to have occurred to him. The \\r\\nmind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous \\r\\nthought presented itself. The process should be automatic, \\r\\ninstinctive. CRIMESTOP, they called it in Newspeak.\\r\\nHe set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He pre\\x02sented himself with propositions—’the Party says the earth \\r\\nis flat’, ‘the party says that ice is heavier than water’—and \\r\\ntrained himself in not seeing or not understanding the ar\\x02guments that contradicted them. It was not easy. It needed \\r\\ngreat powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arith\\x02metical problems raised, for instance, by such a statement \\r\\nas ‘two and two make five’ were beyond his intellectual \\r\\ngrasp. It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability \\r\\nat one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and \\r\\nat the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors. \\r\\nStupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult \\r\\nto attain.\\r\\nAll the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered \\r\\nhow soon they would shoot him. ‘Everything depends on \\r\\nyourself,’ O’Brien had said; but he knew that there was no \\r\\nconscious act by which he could bring it nearer. It might \\r\\nbe ten minutes hence, or ten years. They might keep him \\n352 1984\\r\\nfor years in solitary confinement, they might send him to \\r\\na labour-camp, they might release him for a while, as they \\r\\nsometimes did. It was perfectly possible that before he was \\r\\nshot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would \\r\\nbe enacted all over again. The one certain thing was that \\r\\ndeath never came at an expected moment. The tradition—\\r\\nthe unspoken tradition: somehow you knew it, though you \\r\\nnever heard it said—was that they shot you from behind; \\r\\nalways in the back of the head, without warning, as you \\r\\nwalked down a corridor from cell to cell.\\r\\nOne day—but ‘one day’ was not the right expression; just \\r\\nas probably it was in the middle of the night: once—he fell \\r\\ninto a strange, blissful reverie. He was walking down the \\r\\ncorridor, waiting for the bullet. He knew that it was com\\x02ing in another moment. Everything was settled, smoothed \\r\\nout, reconciled. There were no more doubts, no more argu\\x02ments, no more pain, no more fear. His body was healthy \\r\\nand strong. He walked easily, with a joy of movement and \\r\\nwith a feeling of walking in sunlight. He was not any longer \\r\\nin the narrow white corridors in the Ministry of Love, he \\r\\nwas in the enormous sunlit passage, a kilometre wide, down \\r\\nwhich he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced by \\r\\ndrugs. He was in the Golden Country, following the foot\\x02track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture. He could feel \\r\\nthe short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sun\\x02shine on his face. At the edge of the field were the elm trees, \\r\\nfaintly stirring, and somewhere beyond that was the stream \\r\\nwhere the dace lay in the green pools under the willows.\\r\\nSuddenly he started up with a shock of horror. The \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 353\\r\\nsweat broke out on his backbone. He had heard himself cry \\r\\naloud:\\r\\n‘Julia! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia!’\\r\\nFor a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucina\\x02tion of her presence. She had seemed to be not merely with \\r\\nhim, but inside him. It was as though she had got into the \\r\\ntexture of his skin. In that moment he had loved her far \\r\\nmore than he had ever done when they were together and \\r\\nfree. Also he knew that somewhere or other she was still \\r\\nalive and needed his help.\\r\\nHe lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. \\r\\nWhat had he done? How many years had he added to his \\r\\nservitude by that moment of weakness?\\r\\nIn another moment he would hear the tramp of boots \\r\\noutside. They could not let such an outburst go unpunished. \\r\\nThey would know now, if they had not known before, that \\r\\nhe was breaking the agreement he had made with them. He \\r\\nobeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old \\r\\ndays he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an appear\\x02ance of conformity. Now he had retreated a step further: \\r\\nin the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped to keep \\r\\nthe inner heart inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, \\r\\nbut he preferred to be in the wrong. They would understand \\r\\nthat—O’Brien would understand it. It was all confessed in \\r\\nthat single foolish cry.\\r\\nHe would have to start all over again. It might take years. \\r\\nHe ran a hand over his face, trying to familiarize himself \\r\\nwith the new shape. There were deep furrows in the cheeks, \\r\\nthe cheekbones felt sharp, the nose flattened. Besides, since \\n354 1984\\r\\nlast seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete \\r\\nnew set of teeth. It was not easy to preserve inscrutabili\\x02ty when you did not know what your face looked like. In \\r\\nany case, mere control of the features was not enough. For \\r\\nthe first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret \\r\\nyou must also hide it from yourself. You must know all the \\r\\nwhile that it is there, but until it is needed you must never let \\r\\nit emerge into your consciousness in any shape that could \\r\\nbe given a name. From now onwards he must not only think \\r\\nright; he must feel right, dream right. And all the while he \\r\\nmust keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of \\r\\nmatter which was part of himself and yet unconnected with \\r\\nthe rest of him, a kind of cyst.\\r\\nOne day they would decide to shoot him. You could not \\r\\ntell when it would happen, but a few seconds beforehand \\r\\nit should be possible to guess. It was always from behind, \\r\\nwalking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be enough. In \\r\\nthat time the world inside him could turn over. And then \\r\\nsuddenly, without a word uttered, without a check in his \\r\\nstep, without the changing of a line in his face—suddenly \\r\\nthe camouflage would be down and bang! would go the bat\\x02teries of his hatred. Hatred would fill him like an enormous \\r\\nroaring flame. And almost in the same instant bang! would \\r\\ngo the bullet, too late, or too early. They would have blown \\r\\nhis brain to pieces before they could reclaim it. The hereti\\x02cal thought would be unpunished, unrepented, out of their \\r\\nreach for ever. They would have blown a hole in their own \\r\\nperfection. To die hating them, that was freedom.\\r\\nHe shut his eyes. It was more difficult than accepting \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 355\\r\\nan intellectual discipline. It was a question of degrading \\r\\nhimself, mutilating himself. He had got to plunge into the \\r\\nfilthiest of filth. What was the most horrible, sickening thing \\r\\nof all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous face (be\\x02cause of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought \\r\\nof it as being a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache \\r\\nand the eyes that followed you to and fro, seemed to float \\r\\ninto his mind of its own accord. What were his true feelings \\r\\ntowards Big Brother?\\r\\nThere was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. The \\r\\nsteel door swung open with a clang. O’Brien walked into \\r\\nthe cell. Behind him were the waxen-faced officer and the \\r\\nblack-uniformed guards.\\r\\n‘Get up,’ said O’Brien. ‘Come here.’\\r\\nWinston stood opposite him. O’Brien took Winston’s \\r\\nshoulders between his strong hands and looked at him \\r\\nclosely.\\r\\n‘You have had thoughts of deceiving me,’ he said. ‘That \\r\\nwas stupid. Stand up straighter. Look me in the face.’\\r\\nHe paused, and went on in a gentler tone:\\r\\n‘You are improving. Intellectually there is very little \\r\\nwrong with you. It is only emotionally that you have failed \\r\\nto make progress. Tell me, Winston—and remember, no \\r\\nlies: you know that I am always able to detect a lie—tell me, \\r\\nwhat are your true feelings towards Big Brother?’\\r\\n‘I hate him.’\\r\\n‘You hate him. Good. Then the time has come for you \\r\\nto take the last step. You must love Big Brother. It is not \\r\\nenough to obey him: you must love him.’\\n356 1984\\r\\nHe released Winston with a little push towards the \\r\\nguards.\\r\\n‘Room 101,’ he said.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 357\\r\\nChapter 5\\r\\nAt each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or \\r\\nseemed to know, whereabouts he was in the window\\x02less building. Possibly there were slight differences in the air \\r\\npressure. The cells where the guards had beaten him were \\r\\nbelow ground level. The room where he had been interro\\x02gated by O’Brien was high up near the roof. This place was \\r\\nmany metres underground, as deep down as it was possible \\r\\nto go.\\r\\nIt was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But \\r\\nhe hardly noticed his surroundings. All he noticed was that \\r\\nthere were two small tables straight in front of him, each \\r\\ncovered with green baize. One was only a metre or two \\r\\nfrom him, the other was further away, near the door. He \\r\\nwas strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could \\r\\nmove nothing, not even his head. A sort of pad gripped his \\r\\nhead from behind, forcing him to look straight in front of \\r\\nhim.\\r\\nFor a moment he was alone, then the door opened and \\r\\nO’Brien came in.\\r\\n‘You asked me once,’ said O’Brien, ‘what was in Room \\r\\n101. I told you that you knew the answer already. Everyone \\r\\nknows it. The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing \\r\\nin the world.’\\r\\nThe door opened again. A guard came in, carrying some-\\n358 1984\\r\\nthing made of wire, a box or basket of some kind. He set \\r\\nit down on the further table. Because of the position in \\r\\nwhich O’Brien was standing. Winston could not see what \\r\\nthe thing was.\\r\\n‘The worst thing in the world,’ said O’Brien, ‘varies from \\r\\nindividual to individual. It may be burial alive, or death by \\r\\nfire, or by drowning, or by impalement, or fifty other deaths. \\r\\nThere are cases where it is some quite trivial thing, not even \\r\\nfatal.’\\r\\nHe had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a \\r\\nbetter view of the thing on the table. It was an oblong wire \\r\\ncage with a handle on top for carrying it by. Fixed to the \\r\\nfront of it was something that looked like a fencing mask, \\r\\nwith the concave side outwards. Although it was three or \\r\\nfour metres away from him, he could see that the cage was \\r\\ndivided lengthways into two compartments, and that there \\r\\nwas some kind of creature in each. They were rats.\\r\\n‘In your case,’ said O’Brien, ‘the worst thing in the world \\r\\nhappens to be rats.’\\r\\nA sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain \\r\\nwhat, had passed through Winston as soon as he caught his \\r\\nfirst glimpse of the cage. But at this moment the meaning of \\r\\nthe mask-like attachment in front of it suddenly sank into \\r\\nhim. His bowels seemed to turn to water.\\r\\n‘You can’t do that!’ he cried out in a high cracked voice. \\r\\n‘You couldn’t, you couldn’t! It’s impossible.’\\r\\n‘Do you remember,’ said O’Brien, ‘the moment of pan\\x02ic that used to occur in your dreams? There was a wall of \\r\\nblackness in front of you, and a roaring sound in your ears. \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 359\\r\\nThere was something terrible on the other side of the wall. \\r\\nYou knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag \\r\\nit into the open. It was the rats that were on the other side \\r\\nof the wall.’\\r\\n‘O’Brien!’ said Winston, making an effort to control his \\r\\nvoice. ‘You know this is not necessary. What is it that you \\r\\nwant me to do?’\\r\\nO’Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was \\r\\nin the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected. \\r\\nHe looked thoughtfully into the distance, as though he were \\r\\naddressing an audience somewhere behind Winston’s back.\\r\\n‘By itself,’ he said, ‘pain is not always enough. There \\r\\nare occasions when a human being will stand out against \\r\\npain, even to the point of death. But for everyone there is \\r\\nsomething unendurable—something that cannot be con\\x02templated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you \\r\\nare falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a \\r\\nrope. If you have come up from deep water it is not coward\\x02ly to fill your lungs with air. It is merely an instinct which \\r\\ncannot be destroyed. It is the same with the rats. For you, \\r\\nthey are unendurable. They are a form of pressure that you \\r\\ncannot withstand, even if you wished to. You will do what \\r\\nis required of you.’\\r\\n‘But what is it, what is it? How can I do it if I don’t know \\r\\nwhat it is?’\\r\\nO’Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the \\r\\nnearer table. He set it down carefully on the baize cloth. \\r\\nWinston could hear the blood singing in his ears. He had the \\r\\nfeeling of sitting in utter loneliness. He was in the middle \\n360 1984\\r\\nof a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with sunlight, \\r\\nacross which all sounds came to him out of immense dis\\x02tances. Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away \\r\\nfrom him. They were enormous rats. They were at the age \\r\\nwhen a rat’s muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown \\r\\ninstead of grey.\\r\\n‘The rat,’ said O’Brien, still addressing his invisible audi\\x02ence, ‘although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware of \\r\\nthat. You will have heard of the things that happen in the \\r\\npoor quarters of this town. In some streets a woman dare \\r\\nnot leave her baby alone in the house, even for five minutes. \\r\\nThe rats are certain to attack it. Within quite a small time \\r\\nthey will strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or dy\\x02ing people. They show astonishing intelligence in knowing \\r\\nwhen a human being is helpless.’\\r\\nThere was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed \\r\\nto reach Winston from far away. The rats were fighting; they \\r\\nwere trying to get at each other through the partition. He \\r\\nheard also a deep groan of despair. That, too, seemed to \\r\\ncome from outside himself.\\r\\nO’Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed \\r\\nsomething in it. There was a sharp click. Winston made \\r\\na frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair. It was \\r\\nhopeless; every part of him, even his head, was held im\\x02movably. O’Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than a \\r\\nmetre from Winston’s face.\\r\\n‘I have pressed the first lever,’ said O’Brien. ‘You under\\x02stand the construction of this cage. The mask will fit over \\r\\nyour head, leaving no exit. When I press this other lever, \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 361\\r\\nthe door of the cage will slide up. These starving brutes will \\r\\nshoot out of it like bullets. Have you ever seen a rat leap \\r\\nthrough the air? They will leap on to your face and bore \\r\\nstraight into it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first. Some\\x02times they burrow through the cheeks and devour the \\r\\ntongue.’\\r\\nThe cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a \\r\\nsuccession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in \\r\\nthe air above his head. But he fought furiously against his \\r\\npanic. To think, to think, even with a split second left—to \\r\\nthink was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty odour of \\r\\nthe brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convul\\x02sion of nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. \\r\\nEverything had gone black. For an instant he was insane, a \\r\\nscreaming animal. Yet he came out of the blackness clutch\\x02ing an idea. There was one and only one way to save himself. \\r\\nHe must interpose another human being, the BODY of an\\x02other human being, between himself and the rats.\\r\\nThe circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out \\r\\nthe vision of anything else. The wire door was a couple of \\r\\nhand-spans from his face. The rats knew what was coming \\r\\nnow. One of them was leaping up and down, the other, an \\r\\nold scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink \\r\\nhands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston \\r\\ncould see the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the black \\r\\npanic took hold of him. He was blind, helpless, mindless.\\r\\n‘It was a common punishment in Imperial China,’ said \\r\\nO’Brien as didactically as ever.\\r\\nThe mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his \\n362 1984\\r\\ncheek. And then—no, it was not relief, only hope, a tiny \\r\\nfragment of hope. Too late, perhaps too late. But he had \\r\\nsuddenly understood that in the whole world there was just \\r\\nONE person to whom he could transfer his punishment—\\r\\nONE body that he could thrust between himself and the \\r\\nrats. And he was shouting frantically, over and over.\\r\\n‘Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don’t care \\r\\nwhat you do to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. \\r\\nNot me! Julia! Not me!’\\r\\nHe was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away \\r\\nfrom the rats. He was still strapped in the chair, but he had \\r\\nfallen through the floor, through the walls of the build\\x02ing, through the earth, through the oceans, through the \\r\\natmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the \\r\\nstars—always away, away, away from the rats. He was light \\r\\nyears distant, but O’Brien was still standing at his side. \\r\\nThere was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek. But \\r\\nthrough the darkness that enveloped him he heard another \\r\\nmetallic click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shut \\r\\nand not open.\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 363\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\nThe Chestnut Tree was almost empty. A ray of sunlight \\r\\nslanting through a window fell on dusty table-tops. It \\r\\nwas the lonely hour of fifteen. A tinny music trickled from \\r\\nthe telescreens.\\r\\nWinston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty \\r\\nglass. Now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed \\r\\nhim from the opposite wall. BIG BROTHER IS WATCH\\x02ING YOU, the caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came and \\r\\nfilled his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into it a few \\r\\ndrops from another bottle with a quill through the cork. It \\r\\nwas saccharine flavoured with cloves, the speciality of the \\r\\ncafe.\\r\\nWinston was listening to the telescreen. At present only \\r\\nmusic was coming out of it, but there was a possibility that \\r\\nat any moment there might be a special bulletin from the \\r\\nMinistry of Peace. The news from the African front was dis\\x02quieting in the extreme. On and off he had been worrying \\r\\nabout it all day. A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war with \\r\\nEurasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia) was \\r\\nmoving southward at terrifying speed. The mid-day bulle\\x02tin had not mentioned any definite area, but it was probable \\r\\nthat already the mouth of the Congo was a battlefield. Braz\\x02zaville and Leopoldville were in danger. One did not have \\r\\nto look at the map to see what it meant. It was not merely \\n364 1984\\r\\na question of losing Central Africa: for the first time in the \\r\\nwhole war, the territory of Oceania itself was menaced.\\r\\nA violent emotion, not fear exactly but a sort of undif\\x02ferentiated excitement, flared up in him, then faded again. \\r\\nHe stopped thinking about the war. In these days he could \\r\\nnever fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few \\r\\nmoments at a time. He picked up his glass and drained it \\r\\nat a gulp. As always, the gin made him shudder and even \\r\\nretch slightly. The stuff was horrible. The cloves and sac\\x02charine, themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way, \\r\\ncould not disguise the flat oily smell; and what was worst \\r\\nof all was that the smell of gin, which dwelt with him night \\r\\nand day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the \\r\\nsmell of those——\\r\\nHe never named them, even in his thoughts, and so \\r\\nfar as it was possible he never visualized them. They were \\r\\nsomething that he was half-aware of, hovering close to his \\r\\nface, a smell that clung to his nostrils. As the gin rose in \\r\\nhim he belched through purple lips. He had grown fatter \\r\\nsince they released him, and had regained his old colour—\\r\\nindeed, more than regained it. His features had thickened, \\r\\nthe skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red, even \\r\\nthe bald scalp was too deep a pink. A waiter, again unbid\\x02den, brought the chessboard and the current issue of ‘The \\r\\nTimes’, with the page turned down at the chess problem. \\r\\nThen, seeing that Winston’s glass was empty, he brought the \\r\\ngin bottle and filled it. There was no need to give orders. \\r\\nThey knew his habits. The chessboard was always waiting \\r\\nfor him, his corner table was always reserved; even when \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 365\\r\\nthe place was full he had it to himself, since nobody cared \\r\\nto be seen sitting too close to him. He never even bothered \\r\\nto count his drinks. At irregular intervals they presented \\r\\nhim with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill, \\r\\nbut he had the impression that they always undercharged \\r\\nhim. It would have made no difference if it had been the \\r\\nother way about. He had always plenty of money nowadays. \\r\\nHe even had a job, a sinecure, more highly-paid than his old \\r\\njob had been.\\r\\nThe music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took \\r\\nover. Winston raised his head to listen. No bulletins from \\r\\nthe front, however. It was merely a brief announcement \\r\\nfrom the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding quarter, it ap\\x02peared, the Tenth Three-Year Plan’s quota for bootlaces had \\r\\nbeen overfulfilled by 98 per cent.\\r\\nHe examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It \\r\\nwas a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights. ‘White to \\r\\nplay and mate in two moves.’ Winston looked up at the por\\x02trait of Big Brother. White always mates, he thought with a \\r\\nsort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without exception, it is so \\r\\narranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of the \\r\\nworld has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, \\r\\nunvarying triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed \\r\\nback at him, full of calm power. White always mates.\\r\\nThe voice from the telescreen paused and added in a dif\\x02ferent and much graver tone: ‘You are warned to stand by \\r\\nfor an important announcement at fifteen-thirty. Fifteen\\x02thirty! This is news of the highest importance. Take care \\r\\nnot to miss it. Fifteen-thirty!’ The tinkling music struck up \\n366 1984\\r\\nagain.\\r\\nWinston’s heart stirred. That was the bulletin from the \\r\\nfront; instinct told him that it was bad news that was com\\x02ing. All day, with little spurts of excitement, the thought \\r\\nof a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and out of his \\r\\nmind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarm\\x02ing across the never-broken frontier and pouring down \\r\\ninto the tip of Africa like a column of ants. Why had it not \\r\\nbeen possible to outflank them in some way? The outline of \\r\\nthe West African coast stood out vividly in his mind. He \\r\\npicked up the white knight and moved it across the board. \\r\\nTHERE was the proper spot. Even while he saw the black \\r\\nhorde racing southward he saw another force, mysteriously \\r\\nassembled, suddenly planted in their rear, cutting their co\\x02munications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it he \\r\\nwas bringing that other force into existence. But it was nec\\x02essary to act quickly. If they could get control of the whole \\r\\nof Africa, if they had airfields and submarine bases at the \\r\\nCape, it would cut Oceania in two. It might mean anything: \\r\\ndefeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the destruc\\x02tion of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinary \\r\\nmedley of feeling—but it was not a medley, exactly; rather it \\r\\nwas successive layers of feeling, in which one could not say \\r\\nwhich layer was undermost—struggled inside him.\\r\\nThe spasm passed. He put the white knight back in its \\r\\nplace, but for the moment he could not settle down to se\\x02rious study of the chess problem. His thoughts wandered \\r\\nagain. Almost unconsciously he traced with his finger in \\r\\nthe dust on the table:\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 367\\r\\n2+2=5 \\r\\n‘They can’t get inside you,’ she had said. But they could \\r\\nget inside you. ‘What happens to you here is FOR EVER,’ \\r\\nO’Brien had said. That was a true word. There were things, \\r\\nyour own acts, from which you could never recover. Some\\x02thing was killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out.\\r\\nHe had seen her; he had even spoken to her. There was \\r\\nno danger in it. He knew as though instinctively that they \\r\\nnow took almost no interest in his doings. He could have \\r\\narranged to meet her a second time if either of them had \\r\\nwanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. It \\r\\nwas in the Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when the \\r\\nearth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there \\r\\nwas not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which had \\r\\npushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. He \\r\\nwas hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes \\r\\nwhen he saw her not ten metres away from him. It struck \\r\\nhim at once that she had changed in some ill-defined way. \\r\\nThey almost passed one another without a sign, then he \\r\\nturned and followed her, not very eagerly. He knew that \\r\\nthere was no danger, nobody would take any interest in him. \\r\\nShe did not speak. She walked obliquely away across the \\r\\ngrass as though trying to get rid of him, then seemed to re\\x02sign herself to having him at her side. Presently they were in \\r\\namong a clump of ragged leafless shrubs, useless either for \\r\\nconcealment or as protection from the wind. They halted. \\r\\nIt was vilely cold. The wind whistled through the twigs and \\r\\nfretted the occasional, dirty-looking crocuses. He put his \\n368 1984\\r\\narm round her waist.\\r\\nThere was no telescreen, but there must be hidden \\r\\nmicrophones: besides, they could be seen. It did not mat\\x02ter, nothing mattered. They could have lain down on the \\r\\nground and done THAT if they had wanted to. His flesh \\r\\nfroze with horror at the thought of it. She made no response \\r\\nwhatever to the clasp of his arm; she did not even try to dis\\x02engage herself. He knew now what had changed in her. Her \\r\\nface was sallower, and there was a long scar, partly hidden \\r\\nby the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that was not \\r\\nthe change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in \\r\\na surprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how once, \\r\\nafter the explosion of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag \\r\\na corpse out of some ruins, and had been astonished not \\r\\nonly by the incredible weight of the thing, but by its rigidity \\r\\nand awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more like \\r\\nstone than flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to him \\r\\nthat the texture of her skin would be quite different from \\r\\nwhat it had once been.\\r\\nHe did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As they \\r\\nwalked back across the grass, she looked directly at him for \\r\\nthe first time. It was only a momentary glance, full of con\\x02tempt and dislike. He wondered whether it was a dislike that \\r\\ncame purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also \\r\\nby his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeez\\x02ing from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, side by \\r\\nside but not too close together. He saw that she was about \\r\\nto speak. She moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and \\r\\ndeliberately crushed a twig. Her feet seemed to have grown \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 369\\r\\nbroader, he noticed.\\r\\n‘I betrayed you,’ she said baldly.\\r\\n‘I betrayed you,’ he said.\\r\\nShe gave him another quick look of dislike.\\r\\n‘Sometimes,’ she said, ‘they threaten you with something \\r\\nsomething you can’t stand up to, can’t even think about. \\r\\nAnd then you say, ‘Don’t do it to me, do it to somebody \\r\\nelse, do it to so-and-so.’ And perhaps you might pretend, \\r\\nafterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it \\r\\nto make them stop and didn’t really mean it. But that isn’t \\r\\ntrue. At the time when it happens you do mean it. You think \\r\\nthere’s no other way of saving yourself, and you’re quite \\r\\nready to save yourself that way. You WANT it to happen to \\r\\nthe other person. You don’t give a damn what they suffer. \\r\\nAll you care about is yourself.’\\r\\n‘All you care about is yourself,’ he echoed.\\r\\n‘And after that, you don’t feel the same towards the other \\r\\nperson any longer.’\\r\\n‘No,’ he said, ‘you don’t feel the same.’\\r\\nThere did not seem to be anything more to say. The wind \\r\\nplastered their thin overalls against their bodies. Almost at \\r\\nonce it became embarrassing to sit there in silence: besides, \\r\\nit was too cold to keep still. She said something about catch\\x02ing her Tube and stood up to go.\\r\\n‘We must meet again,’ he said.\\r\\n‘Yes,’ she said, ‘we must meet again.’\\r\\nHe followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace \\r\\nbehind her. They did not speak again. She did not actually \\r\\ntry to shake him off, but walked at just such a speed as to \\n370 1984\\r\\nprevent his keeping abreast of her. He had made up his mind \\r\\nthat he would accompany her as far as the Tube station, but \\r\\nsuddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed \\r\\npointless and unbearable. He was overwhelmed by a desire \\r\\nnot so much to get away from Julia as to get back to the \\r\\nChestnut Tree Cafe, which had never seemed so attractive \\r\\nas at this moment. He had a nostalgic vision of his corner \\r\\ntable, with the newspaper and the chessboard and the ever\\x02flowing gin. Above all, it would be warm in there. The next \\r\\nmoment, not altogether by accident, he allowed himself to \\r\\nbecome separated from her by a small knot of people. He \\r\\nmade a halfhearted attempt to catch up, then slowed down, \\r\\nturned, and made off in the opposite direction. When he \\r\\nhad gone fifty metres he looked back. The street was not \\r\\ncrowded, but already he could not distinguish her. Any one \\r\\nof a dozen hurrying figures might have been hers. Perhaps \\r\\nher thickened, stiffened body was no longer recognizable \\r\\nfrom behind.\\r\\n‘At the time when it happens,’ she had said, ‘you do mean \\r\\nit.’ He had meant it. He had not merely said it, he had wished \\r\\nit. He had wished that she and not he should be delivered \\r\\nover to the——\\r\\nSomething changed in the music that trickled from the \\r\\ntelescreen. A cracked and jeering note, a yellow note, came \\r\\ninto it. And then—perhaps it was not happening, perhaps \\r\\nit was only a memory taking on the semblance of sound—a \\r\\nvoice was singing:\\r\\n‘Under the spreading chestnut tree \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 371\\r\\nI sold you and you sold me——’\\r\\nThe tears welled up in his eyes. A passing waiter noticed \\r\\nthat his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle.\\r\\nHe took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff grew \\r\\nnot less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank. \\r\\nBut it had become the element he swam in. It was his life, \\r\\nhis death, and his resurrection. It was gin that sank him \\r\\ninto stupor every night, and gin that revived him every \\r\\nmorning. When he woke, seldom before eleven hundred, \\r\\nwith gummed-up eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that \\r\\nseemed to be broken, it would have been impossible even \\r\\nto rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle \\r\\nand teacup placed beside the bed overnight. Through the \\r\\nmidday hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy, lis\\x02tening to the telescreen. From fifteen to closing-time he \\r\\nwas a fixture in the Chestnut Tree. No one cared what he \\r\\ndid any longer, no whistle woke him, no telescreen admon\\x02ished him. Occasionally, perhaps twice a week, he went to a \\r\\ndusty, forgotten-looking office in the Ministry of Truth and \\r\\ndid a little work, or what was called work. He had been ap\\x02pointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which had \\r\\nsprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing \\r\\nwith minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of the \\r\\nEleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. They were \\r\\nengaged in producing something called an Interim Report, \\r\\nbut what it was that they were reporting on he had never \\r\\ndefinitely found out. It was something to do with the ques\\x02tion of whether commas should be placed inside brackets, \\n372 1984\\r\\nor outside. There were four others on the committee, all of \\r\\nthem persons similar to himself. There were days when they \\r\\nassembled and then promptly dispersed again, frankly ad\\x02mitting to one another that there was not really anything to \\r\\nbe done. But there were other days when they settled down \\r\\nto their work almost eagerly, making a tremendous show \\r\\nof entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda \\r\\nwhich were never finished—when the argument as to what \\r\\nthey were supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarily \\r\\ninvolved and abstruse, with subtle haggling over definitions, \\r\\nenormous digressions, quarrels—threats, even, to appeal to \\r\\nhigher authority. And then suddenly the life would go out \\r\\nof them and they would sit round the table looking at one \\r\\nanother with extinct eyes, like ghosts fading at cock-crow.\\r\\nThe telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raised \\r\\nhis head again. The bulletin! But no, they were merely \\r\\nchanging the music. He had the map of Africa behind his \\r\\neyelids. The movement of the armies was a diagram: a black \\r\\narrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow hori\\x02zontally eastward, across the tail of the first. As though for \\r\\nreassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the \\r\\nportrait. Was it conceivable that the second arrow did not \\r\\neven exist?\\r\\nHis interest flagged again. He drank another mouthful of \\r\\ngin, picked up the white knight and made a tentative move. \\r\\nCheck. But it was evidently not the right move, because——\\r\\nUncalled, a memory floated into his mind. He saw a \\r\\ncandle-lit room with a vast white-counterpaned bed, and \\r\\nhimself, a boy of nine or ten, sitting on the floor, shaking \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 373\\r\\na dice-box, and laughing excitedly. His mother was sitting \\r\\nopposite him and also laughing.\\r\\nIt must have been about a month before she disappeared. \\r\\nIt was a moment of reconciliation, when the nagging hun\\x02ger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for \\r\\nher had temporarily revived. He remembered the day well, \\r\\na pelting, drenching day when the water streamed down \\r\\nthe window-pane and the light indoors was too dull to read \\r\\nby. The boredom of the two children in the dark, cramped \\r\\nbedroom became unbearable. Winston whined and griz\\x02zled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the room \\r\\npulling everything out of place and kicking the wainscot\\x02ing until the neighbours banged on the wall, while the \\r\\nyounger child wailed intermittently. In the end his mother \\r\\nsaid, ‘Now be good, and I’Il buy you a toy. A lovely toy—\\r\\nyou’ll love it’; and then she had gone out in the rain, to a \\r\\nlittle general shop which was still sporadically open nearby, \\r\\nand came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit \\r\\nof Snakes and Ladders. He could still remember the smell \\r\\nof the damp cardboard. It was a miserable outfit. The board \\r\\nwas cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that \\r\\nthey would hardly lie on their sides. Winston looked at the \\r\\nthing sulkily and without interest. But then his mother lit a \\r\\npiece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play. Soon \\r\\nhe was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tid\\x02dly-winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came \\r\\nslithering down the snakes again, almost to the starting\\x02point. They played eight games, winning four each. His tiny \\r\\nsister, too young to understand what the game was about, \\n374 1984\\r\\nhad sat propped up against a bolster, laughing because the \\r\\nothers were laughing. For a whole afternoon they had all \\r\\nbeen happy together, as in his earlier childhood.\\r\\nHe pushed the picture out of his mind. It was a false \\r\\nmemory. He was troubled by false memories occasionally. \\r\\nThey did not matter so long as one knew them for what they \\r\\nwere. Some things had happened, others had not happened. \\r\\nHe turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white \\r\\nknight again. Almost in the same instant it dropped on to \\r\\nthe board with a clatter. He had started as though a pin had \\r\\nrun into him.\\r\\nA shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air. It was the bul\\x02letin! Victory! It always meant victory when a trumpet-call \\r\\npreceded the news. A sort of electric drill ran through the \\r\\ncafe. Even the waiters had started and pricked up their \\r\\nears.\\r\\nThe trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume of \\r\\nnoise. Already an excited voice was gabbling from the tele\\x02screen, but even as it started it was almost drowned by a \\r\\nroar of cheering from outside. The news had run round the \\r\\nstreets like magic. He could hear just enough of what was \\r\\nissuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all hap\\x02pened, as he had foreseen; a vast seaborne armada had \\r\\nsecretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemy’s rear, the \\r\\nwhite arrow tearing across the tail of the black. Fragments \\r\\nof triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din: \\r\\n‘Vast strategic manoeuvre—perfect co-ordination—utter \\r\\nrout—half a million prisoners—complete demoraliza\\x02tion—control of the whole of Africa—bring the war within \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 375\\r\\nmeasurable distance of its end—victory—greatest victory \\r\\nin human history—victory, victory, victory!’\\r\\nUnder the table Winston’s feet made convulsive move\\x02ments. He had not stirred from his seat, but in his mind \\r\\nhe was running, swiftly running, he was with the crowds \\r\\noutside, cheering himself deaf. He looked up again at the \\r\\nportrait of Big Brother. The colossus that bestrode the \\r\\nworld! The rock against which the hordes of Asia dashed \\r\\nthemselves in vain! He thought how ten minutes ago—yes, \\r\\nonly ten minutes—there had still been equivocation in \\r\\nhis heart as he wondered whether the news from the front \\r\\nwould be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was more than a Eur\\x02asian army that had perished! Much had changed in him \\r\\nsince that first day in the Ministry of Love, but the final, in\\x02dispensable, healing change had never happened, until this \\r\\nmoment.\\r\\nThe voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its \\r\\ntale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shouting \\r\\noutside had died down a little. The waiters were turning \\r\\nback to their work. One of them approached with the gin \\r\\nbottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no at\\x02tention as his glass was filled up. He was not running or \\r\\ncheering any longer. He was back in the Ministry of Love, \\r\\nwith everything forgiven, his soul white as snow. He was in \\r\\nthe public dock, confessing everything, implicating every\\x02body. He was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with \\r\\nthe feeling of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at \\r\\nhis back. The long-hoped-for bullet was entering his brain.\\r\\nHe gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had tak-\\n376 1984\\r\\nen him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the \\r\\ndark moustache. O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O \\r\\nstubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! Two gin\\x02scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was \\r\\nall right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. \\r\\nHe had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.\\r\\nTHE END\\r\\nAPPENDIX.\\r\\nThe Principles of Newspeak\\r\\nNewspeak was the official language of Oceania and \\r\\nhad been devised to meet the ideological needs of Ingsoc, \\r\\nor English Socialism. In the year 1984 there was not as yet \\r\\nanyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of commu\\x02nication, either in speech or writing. The leading articles \\r\\nin ‘The Times’ were written in it, but this was a TOUR DE \\r\\nFORCE which could only be carried out by a specialist. It \\r\\nwas expected that Newspeak would have finally supersed\\x02ed Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should call it) by \\r\\nabout the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadi\\x02ly, all Party members tending to use Newspeak words and \\r\\ngrammatical constructions more and more in their every\\x02day speech. The version in use in 1984, and embodied in the \\r\\nNinth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was \\r\\na provisional one, and contained many superfluous words \\r\\nand archaic formations which were due to be suppressed \\r\\nlater. It is with the final, perfected version, as embodied in \\r\\nthe Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary, that we are con\\x02cerned here.\\r\\nThe purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 377\\r\\nmedium of expression for the world-view and mental hab\\x02its proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other \\r\\nmodes of thought impossible. It was intended that when \\r\\nNewspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak \\r\\nforgotten, a heretical thought—that is, a thought diverging \\r\\nfrom the principles of Ingsoc—should be literally unthink\\x02able, at least so far as thought is dependent on words. Its \\r\\nvocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and of\\x02ten very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party \\r\\nmember could properly wish to express, while excluding \\r\\nall other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at \\r\\nthem by indirect methods. This was done partly by the \\r\\ninvention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating unde\\x02sirable words and by stripping such words as remained of \\r\\nunorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all second\\x02ary meanings whatever. To give a single example. The word \\r\\nFREE still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used in \\r\\nsuch statements as ‘This dog is free from lice’ or ‘This field \\r\\nis free from weeds’. It could not be used in its old sense of \\r\\n‘politically free’ or ‘intellectually free’ since political and in\\x02tellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts, and \\r\\nwere therefore of necessity nameless. Quite apart from the \\r\\nsuppression of definitely heretical words, reduction of vo\\x02cabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that \\r\\ncould be dispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeak \\r\\nwas designed not to extend but to DIMINISH the range of \\r\\nthought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting \\r\\nthe choice of words down to a minimum.\\r\\nNewspeak was founded on the English language as we \\n378 1984\\r\\nnow know it, though many Newspeak sentences, even when \\r\\nnot containing newly-created words, would be barely intel\\x02ligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak \\r\\nwords were divided into three distinct classes, known as \\r\\nthe A vocabulary, the B vocabulary (also called compound \\r\\nwords), and the C vocabulary. It will be simpler to discuss \\r\\neach class separately, but the grammatical peculiarities of \\r\\nthe language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the \\r\\nA vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three \\r\\ncategories.\\r\\nTHE A VOCABULARY. The A vocabulary consisted \\r\\nof the words needed for the business of everyday life—for \\r\\nsuch things as eating, drinking, working, putting on one’s \\r\\nclothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles, garden\\x02ing, cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirely \\r\\nof words that we already possess words like HIT, RUN, \\r\\nDOG, TREE, SUGAR, HOUSE, FIELD—but in compari\\x02son with the present-day English vocabulary their number \\r\\nwas extremely small, while their meanings were far more \\r\\nrigidly defined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had \\r\\nbeen purged out of them. So far as it could be achieved, a \\r\\nNewspeak word of this class was simply a staccato sound \\r\\nexpressing ONE clearly understood concept. It would have \\r\\nbeen quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary \\r\\npurposes or for political or philosophical discussion. It was \\r\\nintended only to express simple, purposive thoughts, usu\\x02ally involving concrete objects or physical actions.\\r\\nThe grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding pe\\x02culiarities. The first of these was an almost complete \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 379\\r\\ninterchangeability between different parts of speech. Any \\r\\nword in the language (in principle this applied even to very \\r\\nabstract words such as IF or WHEN) could be used either \\r\\nas verb, noun, adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and \\r\\nthe noun form, when they were of the same root, there was \\r\\nnever any variation, this rule of itself involving the de\\x02struction of many archaic forms. The word THOUGHT, \\r\\nfor example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was tak\\x02en by THINK, which did duty for both noun and verb. No \\r\\netymological principle was followed here: in some cases it \\r\\nwas the original noun that was chosen for retention, in oth\\x02er cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred \\r\\nmeaning were not etymologically connected, one or other \\r\\nof them was frequently suppressed. There was, for example, \\r\\nno such word as CUT, its meaning being sufficiently cov\\x02ered by the noun-verb KNIFE. Adjectives were formed by \\r\\nadding the suffix -FUL to the noun-verb, and adverbs by \\r\\nadding -WISE. Thus for example, SPEEDFUL meant ‘rapid’ \\r\\nand SPEEDWISE meant ‘quickly’. Certain of our present\\x02day adjectives, such as GOOD, STRONG, BIG, BLACK, \\r\\nSOFT, were retained, but their total number was very small. \\r\\nThere was little need for them, since almost any adjectival \\r\\nmeaning could be arrived at by adding -FUL to a noun-verb. \\r\\nNone of the now-existing adverbs was retained, except for a \\r\\nvery few already ending in -WISE: the -WISE termination \\r\\nwas invariable. The word WELL, for example, was replaced \\r\\nby GOODWISE.\\r\\nIn addition, any word—this again applied in principle \\r\\nto every word in the language—could be negatived by add-\\n380 1984\\r\\ning the affix UN-, or could be strengthened by the affix \\r\\nPLUS-, or, for still greater emphasis, DOUBLEPLUS-. Thus, \\r\\nfor example, UNCOLD meant ‘warm’, while PLUSCOLD \\r\\nand DOUBLEPLUSCOLD meant, respectively, ‘very cold’ \\r\\nand ‘superlatively cold’. It was also possible, as in present\\x02day English, to modify the meaning of almost any word by \\r\\nprepositional affixes such as ANTE-, POST-, UP-, DOWN-, \\r\\netc. By such methods it was found possible to bring about \\r\\nan enormous diminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, \\r\\nthe word GOOD, there was no need for such a word as BAD, \\r\\nsince the required meaning was equally well—indeed, bet\\x02ter—expressed by UNGOOD. All that was necessary, in \\r\\nany case where two words formed a natural pair of oppo\\x02sites, was to decide which of them to suppress. DARK, for \\r\\nexample, could be replaced by UNLIGHT, or LIGHT by \\r\\nUNDARK, according to preference.\\r\\nThe second distinguishing mark of Newspeak gram\\x02mar was its regularity. Subject to a few exceptions which \\r\\nare mentioned below all inflexions followed the same rules. \\r\\nThus, in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were \\r\\nthe same and ended in -ED. The preterite of STEAL was \\r\\nSTEALED, the preterite of THINK was THINKED, and \\r\\nso on throughout the language, all such forms as SWAM, \\r\\nGAVE, BROUGHT, SPOKE, TAKEN, etc., being abolished. \\r\\nAll plurals were made by adding -S or -ES as the case might \\r\\nbe. The plurals OF MAN, OX, LIFE, were MANS, OXES, \\r\\nLIFES. Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by \\r\\nadding -ER, -EST (GOOD, GOODER, GOODEST), ir\\x02regular forms and the MORE, MOST formation being \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 381\\r\\nsuppressed.\\r\\nThe only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect \\r\\nirregularly were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstra\\x02tive adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs. All of these followed \\r\\ntheir ancient usage, except that WHOM had been scrapped \\r\\nas unnecessary, and the SHALL, SHOULD tenses had been \\r\\ndropped, all their uses being covered by WILL and WOULD. \\r\\nThere were also certain irregularities in word-formation \\r\\narising out of the need for rapid and easy speech. A word \\r\\nwhich was difficult to utter, or was liable to be incorrectly \\r\\nheard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally \\r\\ntherefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were insert\\x02ed into a word or an archaic formation was retained. But \\r\\nthis need made itself felt chiefly in connexion with the B \\r\\nvocabulary. WHY so great an importance was attached to \\r\\nease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.\\r\\nTHE B VOCABULARY. The B vocabulary consisted of \\r\\nwords which had been deliberately constructed for political \\r\\npurposes: words, that is to say, which not only had in every \\r\\ncase a political implication, but were intended to impose \\r\\na desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. \\r\\nWithout a full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc \\r\\nit was difficult to use these words correctly. In some cases \\r\\nthey could be translated into Oldspeak, or even into words \\r\\ntaken from the A vocabulary, but this usually demanded \\r\\na long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain \\r\\novertones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, of\\x02ten packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and \\r\\nat the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary \\n382 1984\\r\\nlanguage.\\r\\nThe B words were in all cases compound words. [Com\\x02pound words such as SPEAKWRITE, were of course to be \\r\\nfound in the A vocabulary, but these were merely convenient \\r\\nabbreviations and had no special ideologcal colour.] They \\r\\nconsisted of two or more words, or portions of words, weld\\x02ed together in an easily pronounceable form. The resulting \\r\\namalgam was always a noun-verb, and inflected according \\r\\nto the ordinary rules. To take a single example: the word \\r\\nGOODTHINK, meaning, very roughly, ‘orthodoxy’, or, if \\r\\none chose to regard it as a verb, ‘to think in an orthodox \\r\\nmanner’. This inflected as follows: noun-verb, GOOD\\x02THINK; past tense and past participle, GOODTHINKED; \\r\\npresent participle, GOOD-THINKING; adjective, GOOD\\x02THINKFUL; adverb, GOODTHINKWISE; verbal noun, \\r\\nGOODTHINKER.\\r\\nThe B words were not constructed on any etymological \\r\\nplan. The words of which they were made up could be any \\r\\nparts of speech, and could be placed in any order and muti\\x02lated in any way which made them easy to pronounce while \\r\\nindicating their derivation. In the word CRIMETHINK \\r\\n(thoughtcrime), for instance, the THINK came second, \\r\\nwhereas in THINKPOL (Thought Police) it came first, \\r\\nand in the latter word POLICE had lost its second syllable. \\r\\nBecause of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregu\\x02lar formations were commoner in the B vocabulary than \\r\\nin the A vocabulary. For example, the adjective forms of \\r\\nMINITRUE, MINIPAX, and MINILUV were, respectively, \\r\\nMINITRUTHFUL, MINIPEACEFUL, and MINILOVELY, \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 383\\r\\nsimply because -TRUEFUL, -PAXFUL, and -LOVEFUL \\r\\nwere slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle, however, \\r\\nall B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the \\r\\nsame way.\\r\\nSome of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, \\r\\nbarely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the \\r\\nlanguage as a whole. Consider, for example, such a typical \\r\\nsentence from a ‘Times’ leading article as OLDTHINKERS \\r\\nUNBELLYFEEL INGSOC. The shortest rendering that one \\r\\ncould make of this in Oldspeak would be: ‘Those whose \\r\\nideas were formed before the Revolution cannot have a full \\r\\nemotional understanding of the principles of English So\\x02cialism.’ But this is not an adequate translation. To begin \\r\\nwith, in order to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak \\r\\nsentence quoted above, one would have to have a clear idea \\r\\nof what is meant by INGSOC. And in addition, only a per\\x02son thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate the \\r\\nfull force of the word BELLYFEEL, which implied a blind, \\r\\nenthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the \\r\\nword OLDTHINK, which was inextricably mixed up with \\r\\nthe idea of wickedness and decadence. But the special func\\x02tion of certain Newspeak words, of which OLDTHINK \\r\\nwas one, was not so much to express meanings as to de\\x02stroy them. These words, necessarily few in number, had \\r\\nhad their meanings extended until they contained within \\r\\nthemselves whole batteries of words which, as they were \\r\\nsufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could \\r\\nnow be scrapped and forgotten. The greatest difficulty fac\\x02ing the compilers of the Newspeak Dictionary was not to \\n384 1984\\r\\ninvent new words, but, having invented them, to make sure \\r\\nwhat they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of \\r\\nwords they cancelled by their existence.\\r\\nAs we have already seen in the case of the word FREE, \\r\\nwords which had once borne a heretical meaning were \\r\\nsometimes retained for the sake of convenience, but only \\r\\nwith the undesirable meanings purged out of them. Count\\x02less other words such as HONOUR, JUSTICE, MORALITY, \\r\\nINTERNATIONALISM, DEMOCRACY, SCIENCE, and \\r\\nRELIGION had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket words \\r\\ncovered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All \\r\\nwords grouping themselves round the concepts of liber\\x02ty and equality, for instance, were contained in the single \\r\\nword CRIMETHINK, while all words grouping themselves \\r\\nround the concepts of objectivity and rationalism were \\r\\ncontained in the single word OLDTHINK. Greater preci\\x02sion would have been dangerous. What was required in a \\r\\nParty member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient \\r\\nHebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that all na\\x02tions other than his own worshipped ‘false gods’. He did \\r\\nnot need to know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, \\r\\nMoloch, Ashtaroth, and the like: probably the less he knew \\r\\nabout them the better for his orthodoxy. He knew Jehovah \\r\\nand the commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore, \\r\\nthat all gods with other names or other attributes were false \\r\\ngods. In somewhat the same way, the party member knew \\r\\nwhat constituted right conduct, and in exceedingly vague, \\r\\ngeneralized terms he knew what kinds of departure from \\r\\nit were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 385\\r\\nregulated by the two Newspeak words SEXCRIME (sex\\x02ual immorality) and GOODSEX (chastity). SEXCRIME \\r\\ncovered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornica\\x02tion, adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, \\r\\nin addition, normal intercourse practised for its own sake. \\r\\nThere was no need to enumerate them separately, since they \\r\\nwere all equally culpable, and, in principle, all punishable \\r\\nby death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientific \\r\\nand technical words, it might be necessary to give special\\x02ized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary \\r\\ncitizen had no need of them. He knew what was meant by \\r\\nGOODSEX—that is to say, normal intercourse between \\r\\nman and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, \\r\\nand without physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all \\r\\nelse was SEXCRIME. In Newspeak it was seldom possible to \\r\\nfollow a heretical thought further than the perception that \\r\\nit WAS heretical: beyond that point the necessary words \\r\\nwere nonexistent.\\r\\nNo word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. \\r\\nA great many were euphemisms. Such words, for instance, \\r\\nas JOYCAMP (forced-labour camp) or MINIPAX Minis\\x02try of Peace, i.e. Ministry of War) meant almost the exact \\r\\nopposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on \\r\\nthe other hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous un\\x02derstanding of the real nature of Oceanic society. An \\r\\nexample was PROLEFEED, meaning the rubbishy enter\\x02tainment and spurious news which the Party handed out \\r\\nto the masses. Other words, again, were ambivalent, hav\\x02ing the connotation ‘good’ when applied to the Party and \\n386 1984\\r\\n‘bad’ when applied to its enemies. But in addition there were \\r\\ngreat numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be \\r\\nmere abbreviations and which derived their ideological co\\x02lour not from their meaning, but from their structure.\\r\\nSo far as it could be contrived, everything that had or \\r\\nmight have political significance of any kind was fitted into \\r\\nthe B vocabulary. The name of every organization, or body \\r\\nof people, or doctrine, or country, or institution, or public \\r\\nbuilding, was invariably cut down into the familiar shape; \\r\\nthat is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest \\r\\nnumber of syllables that would preserve the original deri\\x02vation. In the Ministry of Truth, for example, the Records \\r\\nDepartment, in which Winston Smith worked, was called \\r\\nRECDEP, the Fiction Department was called FICDEP, the \\r\\nTeleprogrammes Department was called TELEDEP, and so \\r\\non. This was not done solely with the object of saving time. \\r\\nEven in the early decades of the twentieth century, tele\\x02scoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic \\r\\nfeatures of political language; and it had been noticed that \\r\\nthe tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most \\r\\nmarked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organi\\x02zations. Examples were such words as NAZI, GESTAPO, \\r\\nCOMINTERN, INPRECORR, AGITPROP. In the begin\\x02ning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively, \\r\\nbut in Newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose. It \\r\\nwas perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one nar\\x02rowed and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting out most of \\r\\nthe associations that would otherwise cling to it. The words \\r\\nCOMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL, for instance, call up \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 387\\r\\na composite picture of universal human brotherhood, red \\r\\nflags, barricades, Karl Marx, and the Paris Commune. The \\r\\nword COMINTERN, on the other hand, suggests merely a \\r\\ntightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doc\\x02trine. It refers to something almost as easily recognized, \\r\\nand as limited in purpose, as a chair or a table. COMIN\\x02TERN is a word that can be uttered almost without taking \\r\\nthought, whereas COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL is \\r\\na phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least mo\\x02mentarily. In the same way, the associations called up by a \\r\\nword like MINITRUE are fewer and more controllable than \\r\\nthose called up by MINISTRY OF TRUTH. This accounted \\r\\nnot only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but \\r\\nalso for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make \\r\\nevery word easily pronounceable.\\r\\nIn Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration \\r\\nother than exactitude of meaning. Regularity of grammar \\r\\nwas always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary. And \\r\\nrightly so, since what was required, above all for political \\r\\npurposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable mean\\x02ing which could be uttered rapidly and which roused the \\r\\nminimum of echoes in the speaker’s mind. The words of the \\r\\nB vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly \\r\\nall of them were very much alike. Almost invariably these \\r\\nwords—GOODTHINK, MINIPAX, PROLEFEED, SEX\\x02CRIME, JOYCAMP, INGSOC, BELLYFEEL, THINKPOL, \\r\\nand countless others—were words of two or three syllables, \\r\\nwith the stress distributed equally between the first syllable \\r\\nand the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of \\n388 1984\\r\\nspeech, at once staccato and monotonous. And this was ex\\x02actly what was aimed at. The intention was to make speech, \\r\\nand especially speech on any subject not ideologically neu\\x02tral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness. For \\r\\nthe purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or \\r\\nsometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party \\r\\nmember called upon to make a political or ethical judge\\x02ment should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as \\r\\nautomatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets. His \\r\\ntraining fitted him to do this, the language gave him an al\\x02most foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, \\r\\nwith their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which \\r\\nwas in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted the process \\r\\nstill further.\\r\\nSo did the fact of having very few words to choose from. \\r\\nRelative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, \\r\\nand new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised. \\r\\nNewspeak, indeed, differed from most all other languages \\r\\nin that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every \\r\\nyear. Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area \\r\\nof choice, the smaller the temptation to take thought. Ulti\\x02mately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from \\r\\nthe larynx without involving the higher brain centres at \\r\\nall. This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak word \\r\\nDUCKSPEAK, meaning ‘to quack like a duck’. Like various \\r\\nother words in the B vocabulary, DUCKSPEAK was ambiv\\x02alent in meaning. Provided that the opinions which were \\r\\nquacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but \\r\\npraise, and when ‘The Times’ referred to one of the orators \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 389\\r\\nof the Party as a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER it \\r\\nwas paying a warm and valued compliment.\\r\\nTHE C VOCABULARY. The C vocabulary was supple\\x02mentary to the others and consisted entirely of scientific \\r\\nand technical terms. These resembled the scientific terms \\r\\nin use today, and were constructed from the same roots, but \\r\\nthe usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip \\r\\nthem of undesirable meanings. They followed the same \\r\\ngrammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabu\\x02laries. Very few of the C words had any currency either in \\r\\neveryday speech or in political speech. Any scientific work\\x02er or technician could find all the words he needed in the \\r\\nlist devoted to his own speciality, but he seldom had more \\r\\nthan a smattering of the words occurring in the other lists. \\r\\nOnly a very few words were common to all lists, and there \\r\\nwas no vocabulary expressing the function of Science as a \\r\\nhabit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its \\r\\nparticular branches. There was, indeed, no word for ‘Sci\\x02ence’, any meaning that it could possibly bear being already \\r\\nsufficiently covered by the word INGSOC.\\r\\nFrom the foregoing account it will be seen that in New\\x02speak the expression of unorthodox opinions, above a very \\r\\nlow level, was well-nigh impossible. It was of course pos\\x02sible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a species of \\r\\nblasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to say \\r\\nBIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD. But this statement, which \\r\\nto an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absur\\x02dity, could not have been sustained by reasoned argument, \\r\\nbecause the necessary words were not available. Ideas inim-\\n390 1984\\r\\nical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless \\r\\nform, and could only be named in very broad terms which \\r\\nlumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies \\r\\nwithout defining them in doing so. One could, in fact, only \\r\\nuse Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimately \\r\\ntranslating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For ex\\x02ample, ALL MANS ARE EQUAL was a possible Newspeak \\r\\nsentence, but only in the same sense in which ALL MEN \\r\\nARE REDHAIRED is a possible Oldspeak sentence. It did \\r\\nnot contain a grammatical error, but it expressed a palpa\\x02ble untruth—i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, or \\r\\nstrength. The concept of political equality no longer existed, \\r\\nand this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged \\r\\nout of the word EQUAL. In 1984, when Oldspeak was still \\r\\nthe normal means of communication, the danger theo\\x02retically existed that in using Newspeak words one might \\r\\nremember their original meanings. In practice it was not \\r\\ndifficult for any person well grounded in DOUBLETHINK \\r\\nto avoid doing this, but within a couple of generations even \\r\\nthe possibility of such a lapse would have vaished. A per\\x02son growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would \\r\\nno more know that EQUAL had once had the second\\x02ary meaning of ‘politically equal’, or that FREE had once \\r\\nmeant ‘intellectually free’, than for instance, a person who \\r\\nhad never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary \\r\\nmeanings attaching to QUEEN and ROOK. There would \\r\\nbe many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his \\r\\npower to commit, simply because they were nameless and \\r\\ntherefore unimaginable. And it was to be foreseen that with \\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 391\\r\\nthe passage of time the distinguishing characteristics of \\r\\nNewspeak would become more and more pronounced—its \\r\\nwords growing fewer and fewer, their meanings more and \\r\\nmore rigid, and the chance of putting them to improper \\r\\nuses always diminishing.\\r\\nWhen Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, \\r\\nthe last link with the past would have been severed. History \\r\\nhad already been rewritten, but fragments of the literature \\r\\nof the past survived here and there, imperfectly censored, \\r\\nand so long as one retained one’s knowledge of Oldspeak \\r\\nit was possible to read them. In the future such fragments, \\r\\neven if they chanced to survive, would be unintelligible \\r\\nand untranslatable. It was impossible to translate any pas\\x02sage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless it either referred to \\r\\nsome technical process or some very simple everyday ac\\x02tion, or was already orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL would \\r\\nbe the Newspeak expression) in tendency. In practice this \\r\\nmeant that no book written before approximately 1960 \\r\\ncould be translated as a whole. Pre-revolutionary literature \\r\\ncould only be subjected to ideological translation—that is, \\r\\nalteration in sense as well as language. Take for example \\r\\nthe well-known passage from the Declaration of Indepen\\x02dence:\\r\\nWE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, \\r\\nTHAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEY \\r\\nARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN \\r\\nINALIENABLE RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARE \\r\\nLIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. \\n392 1984\\r\\nTHAT TO SECURE THESE RIGHTS, GOVERNMENTS ARE \\r\\nINSTITUTED AMONG MEN, DERIVING THEIR POWERS \\r\\nFROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED. THAT \\r\\nWHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES \\r\\nDESTRUCTIVE OF THOSE ENDS, IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE \\r\\nPEOPLE TO ALTER OR ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE \\r\\nNEW GOVERNMENT...\\r\\nIt would have been quite impossible to render this into \\r\\nNewspeak while keeping to the sense of the original. The \\r\\nnearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow the \\r\\nwhole passage up in the single word CRIMETHINK. A full \\r\\ntranslation could only be an ideological translation, where\\x02by Jefferson’s words would be changed into a panegyric on \\r\\nabsolute government.\\r\\nA good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, al\\x02ready being transformed in this way. Considerations of \\r\\nprestige made it desirable to preserve the memory of cer\\x02tain historical figures, while at the same time bringing \\r\\ntheir achievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc. \\r\\nVarious writers, such as Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, By\\x02ron, Dickens, and some others were therefore in process of \\r\\ntranslation: when the task had been completed, their orig\\x02inal writings, with all else that survived of the literature \\r\\nof the past, would be destroyed. These translations were \\r\\na slow and difficult business, and it was not expected that \\r\\nthey would be finished before the first or second decade of \\r\\nthe twenty-first century. There were also large quantities of \\r\\nmerely utilitarian literature—indispensable technical man-\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com 393\\r\\nuals, and the like—that had to be treated in the same way. It \\r\\nwas chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary work \\r\\nof translation that the final adoption of Newspeak had been \\r\\nfixed for so late a date as 2050.\\n'"
